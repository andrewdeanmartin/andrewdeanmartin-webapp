## ABOUT

```
I'm the person teams call when AI ambition collides with delivery reality: unclear scope, legacy systems, compliance constraints, and a deadline that won't move.

I'm a Director in PwC's Commercial Technology & Innovation group. I operate at the intersection of consulting leadership, product strategy, and hands-on engineering — which means I can move from executive narrative → architecture → working prototype, often in the same week.

What sets me apart:

I don't just manage delivery — I personally build. I design multi-agent pipelines that orchestrate AI through human-in-the-loop workflows. I've compressed weeks of analysis into hours using agentic accelerators. I build interactive prototypes that unblock investment decisions within days — not months.

I also get into the details: AI-augmented codebase assessments, CI/CD pipeline diagnostics, cloud architecture, React/Python stacks, and platform governance. "AI that works" has to survive security reviews, compliance gates, and operational readiness.

My impact shows up in three ways:
→ Speed-to-insight: Compressing discovery and analysis cycles dramatically
→ Quality & consistency: Repeatable outputs instead of bespoke heroics
→ Risk-managed scale: Governance and operational readiness that let solutions move from pilot to production

I invest heavily in building the system around the work — enablement programs, prompt libraries, agent catalogs, and lightweight adoption frameworks (30/60/90 plans, success metrics) so teams can adopt AI at scale, not just experiment with it.

Currently building: agentic delivery accelerators, AI governance frameworks, and interactive tools that make structured prompt engineering accessible to enterprise teams.

If you're working on GenAI delivery, agent platforms, enterprise modernization, or AI governance — I'd like to compare notes.
