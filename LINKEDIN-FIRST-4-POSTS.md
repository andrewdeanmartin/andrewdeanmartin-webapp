## Post 1: The Agent Production Gap

**Best time to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 7–9am ET

```
72% of enterprises are testing AI agents.

Only 5% have them in production.

That gap isn't a technology problem. It's an architecture and governance problem.

Most agent pilots are built for demos: single-agent, happy-path, no error handling, no audit trail. They work beautifully in a meeting room. They break immediately in a production environment with real data, real compliance requirements, and real users who don't follow the script.

The pattern I keep seeing:

→ The pilot uses a different architecture than production would need
→ No one designed for agent-to-agent handoffs or state management
→ There's no human-in-the-loop checkpoint — just end-to-end automation
→ Compliance reviews the output after it's built, not while it's being designed
→ Cost modeling assumes single-agent economics, but multi-agent pipelines can multiply token usage 10-15x

The fix isn't "better agents." It's designing the pipeline for production from day one: explicit agent roles, defined handoff protocols, human checkpoints at decision points, audit trails that compliance can actually review, and cost modeling that accounts for real orchestration overhead.

The organizations getting agents to production aren't the ones with the best models. They're the ones who treat governance as a design requirement, not a review gate.

Building a demo of this approach — a visual, interactive pipeline showing how multi-agent orchestration actually works with human-in-the-loop controls. More soon.
```

**Why this works for each persona:**
- David: Retellable insight ("only 5% in production — here's why")
- Sarah: Validates her fear (compliance after the fact kills projects) and offers her framework
- Priya: Technical substance (state management, handoff protocols, cost modeling)
- Rachel: Positions Andrew as someone with a point of view, not just a title

## Post 2: Governance as Accelerator

**Best time to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 7–9am ET (post 3–5 days after Post 1)

```
73% of enterprise AI pilots never reach production.

The most common killer isn't technical failure. It's governance.

Not "we reviewed it and found problems." More like: "we built it, then discovered no one had thought about compliance, and now we're 6 months into a review process that was never designed for AI."

The average time from AI pilot to production approval is 6–18 months — with most of that time spent in governance and compliance review, not engineering.

Here's what I've learned about making governance fast instead of slow:

1. Build it in, don't bolt it on. If the first time your compliance team sees the AI system is at the end, you've already lost months. Bring them into the design phase. Make them a stakeholder, not a gate.

2. Design for auditability from day one. Every agent decision, every data transformation, every output should have a trace link. Not because someone asked for it — because production systems need it to survive.

3. Human-in-the-loop is a feature, not a limitation. The most successful AI deployments I've seen keep humans at the decision points — not reviewing everything, but reviewing the things that matter. Approve, modify, or escalate. Three options, clear criteria, documented every time.

4. Governance templates beat governance meetings. A structured intake form, a risk classification matrix, and a clear escalation path replace 80% of the "let's schedule a meeting to discuss" cycle.

The organizations shipping AI to production aren't the ones with the fewest rules. They're the ones whose rules are designed for speed.
```

**Why this works:**
- Sarah: This is her exact problem. She'll screenshot this.
- David: "Governance as accelerator" is a pursuit-ready narrative
- Vikas: Shows thought leadership and point of view on a topic CT&I cares about

## Post 3: Why I Build the Demo Before the Deck

**Best time to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 7–9am ET (post 3–5 days after Post 2)

```
I build the demo before the deck.

Not because I don't value strategy — I do. But I've watched too many good ideas die in slide reviews.

The pattern: someone has a strong hypothesis about how AI can improve a process. They write a deck. The deck goes through 3 rounds of feedback. Stakeholders debate the approach in the abstract. Six weeks later, the deck is polished and the window has closed.

What I do instead: build a working prototype in the first week. Not production-ready — a proof of concept that shows the idea working with real inputs.

The prototype changes the conversation. Instead of "do we think this could work?" it becomes "I can see how this works — here's what I'd change." Stakeholders react to something tangible. Feedback is specific. Decisions happen faster.

Three things I've learned from this approach:

→ A mediocre prototype beats a perfect deck. People can't argue with something they can touch.

→ The prototype reveals problems the deck never would. Integration issues, data quality gaps, UX friction — these only surface when you build.

→ Speed builds trust. When leadership sees a working demo 5 days after approval, they trust you with more scope. When they see a deck 5 weeks after approval, they schedule another review.

This isn't about skipping strategy. It's about compressing the distance between strategy and evidence. The deck still gets written — it just has a working demo attached.
```

**Why this works:**
- David: "This is the person I want on my pursuit — builds the demo for the client meeting"
- Sarah: "He gets things built, not just planned"
- Priya: "He actually builds, he's not just a deck jockey"
- Most human and personal of the four — shows Andrew's working style

## Post 4: The Prompt Engineering Methodology

**Best time to post:** Tuesday or Wednesday, 7–9am ET (post 3–5 days after Post 3)

```
Most enterprise AI underperformance isn't a model problem. It's a prompt problem.

Organizations spend months selecting the right LLM, then hand it to teams with no structure for how to actually use it. The result: inconsistent outputs, wasted tokens, hallucination in high-stakes contexts, and teams that conclude "AI doesn't work for our use case" when the real issue was the input, not the model.

I use a simple framework for structuring prompts: Role → Task → Context → Requirements → Output → Input.

Here's what each does:

Role: Who should the AI act as? (Not always needed, but powerful for domain-specific work)
Task: What's the single clear objective? One sentence.
Context: Who's the audience, what's the tone, what constraints apply?
Requirements: 2-3 specific instructions that improve output quality
Output: What format should the result take?
Input: What variables does the user provide?

The difference between a vague prompt and a structured one is dramatic. "Analyze this system for production readiness" becomes a structured assessment prompt that specifies the role (senior architect), the evaluation dimensions (reliability, scalability, security), the output format (findings table with severity ratings), and the input variables (system docs, architecture diagrams, deployment config).

The structured version produces consistent, auditable, repeatable outputs. The vague version produces something different every time.

I'm building an interactive tool around this methodology — enterprise use cases, not consumer ones. Architecture reviews, stakeholder updates, migration analysis, governance assessments. More to come.
```

**Why this works:**
- Introduces SharpPrompt methodology without naming the tool
- Teases the website demo ("building an interactive tool")
- PwC-safe: it's a personal methodology, not firm IP
- Gives real value (the framework) so people save/share the post
- Priya: respects the technical detail
- Sarah: "repeatable, auditable outputs" is her language
