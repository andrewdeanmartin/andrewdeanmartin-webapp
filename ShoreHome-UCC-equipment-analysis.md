|-------|-----|----------------------------|--------|
| Oct 2025 (purchase) | 0 | $75,000 | Assumed purchase price |

| Oct 2030 (UCC expiry) | 5 years | $32,000–$40,000 | ~45–55% cumulative depreciation |

### Use Cases — Roofing / Outdoor Living Contractor

In a ShoreHome-type operation (roofing + pavers + outdoor kitchens + pool decks), the SVL75-3 would be used for:

- **Material handling** — loading/unloading shingle bundles, tile pallets, paver pallets, sand, gravel, concrete
- **Site prep & grading** — leveling ground for paver installations, pool decks, outdoor kitchens
- **Demolition & tear-off hauling** — moving debris from roof tear-offs to dumpsters
- **Backfill and compaction prep** — around pool areas, retaining walls, fire pits
- **Hardscape material placement** — positioning stone, pavers, retaining wall block
- **Snow/storm debris** — post-hurricane cleanup (relevant in Sarasota market)

This is a **core operations machine** for a contractor with ShoreHome's service mix — it replaces multiple pieces of manual labor for material movement and site work.

### Down Payment Norms
- **Standard:** 25%, 30%, or 35% depending on payment frequency
- **Promotional (select models):** 0% down with 0% or 0.99% APR (limited-time offers on specific construction models; SVL75-3 eligibility varies by promotion period)

### Special Offers (as of search date)
- 0% APR / 60 months / $0 down available on select Kubota construction models (U35-4, U48-5, KX series) — **SVL75-3 not listed in current promo, but may have been eligible at Oct 2025 purchase**

- **Loan term:** 60 months (standard KCC product)
- **Interest rate:** Either **10.32% APR** (standard rate) or possibly **0%–0.99%** if purchased during a promotional window
- **Down payment:** Likely 0%–25% depending on whether a promo was used

## 6. Diligence Implications

### What This Equipment Package Tells Us About ShoreHome

1. **Operational maturity signal** — Owning (financing) a $75K+ loader is a meaningful capital commitment for a small contractor. It suggests job volume sufficient to justify machine ownership over rental.
2. **Service mix alignment** — The SVL75-3 + bucket + pallet forks is a textbook setup for a roofing + hardscape contractor. It handles shingle pallets, paver pallets, site grading, and debris removal — core to ShoreHome's stated service lines.
3. **Recency** — The Oct 2025 filing on a new machine suggests the business is investing in growth, not liquidating.
4. **Debt load** — $1,200–$1,500/month in equipment debt service is modest but fixed. For a small contractor, this represents a baseline overhead commitment that requires steady job flow.
5. **Collateral coverage** — At UCC expiry (Oct 2030), the equipment will still hold ~$35,000–$42,000 in residual value against a $0 remaining balance. Kubota Credit is well-collateralized throughout the term.

### Follow-Up Items

- [ ] Confirm whether ShoreHome received promotional financing (0% APR) or standard rates — materially changes annual cost by ~$3,000–$4,000
- [ ] Verify equipment is insured (required by Kubota Credit terms)
- [ ] Check for additional UCC filings (vehicles, other equipment)
- [ ] Cross-reference equipment investment timing with revenue trajectory — is this growth capex or replacement?
