# UX Prompt: Asian Aesthetics & Sense of Place

**Purpose:** Deep research and a reusable UX prompt to design webpages that feel *right*—aligned with Eastern notions of beauty (spacing, harmony, restraint, flow) and a strong "sense of place" so the experience feels grounded, calm, and intentional rather than generic or noisy.

**Author note:** The author is not Asian. These principles are adopted as **best practice** in this style guide—informed by and inspired by East Asian design traditions—not as a claim to cultural identity or authentic representation. Use them as a shared design language for clarity, calm, and sense of place.

## 1. Research Summary: Why It "Feels Right"

That feeling when something *lands*—when a page feels balanced, clear, and somehow *in place*—isn’t random. It maps to principles that show up across Asian design traditions: **Feng Shui** (energy flow, balance, commanding position), **Japanese Ma** (meaningful negative space), **wabi-sabi** (restraint, imperfection, simplicity), **yūgen** (subtlety, suggestion over declaration), and the **seven Zen aesthetic principles**. Together they emphasize:

- **Space as substance** — Empty space isn’t “wasted”; it’s where meaning and focus live.
- **Flow and rhythm** — Movement (scroll, transitions, hierarchy) should feel like a path, not a maze.
- **Restraint over excess** — Fewer elements, each purposeful; suggestion over shouting.
- **Balance without rigid symmetry** — Natural, asymmetrical balance (Fukinsei) feels more alive than perfect grids.
- **Atmosphere over decoration** — Mood and “sense of place” matter as much as individual widgets.

"Sense of place" in design is defined as **knowing a space the way you know a person**—forming real, affective connections. Research frames it around: **Symbolism**, **Purpose**, **Identity**, **Relation**, and **Emotion**. Your goal is to make the page feel like a *place* people recognize and want to return to, not a template.

## 2. Core Principles (Quick Reference)

| Principle | Origin | UX translation |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Ma (間)** | Japanese | Space and pause are active. Use whitespace to create rhythm, breathing room, and focus. "The silence between the notes." |
| **Feng Shui (flow)** | Chinese | Clear information flow; no dead ends. Key elements in "commanding position" (visible quickly). Vertical movement suggests growth. |
| **Yin & Yang** | Chinese | Balance aesthetics and function. Neither sterile nor chaotic. |
| **Kanso** | Zen | Simplicity: remove non-essential elements so the essential has power. |
| **Fukinsei** | Zen | Asymmetry and irregularity; avoid rigid perfection. |
| **Shibui / Shibumi** | Japanese | Understated beauty: muted, elegant, no visual shouting. |
| **Yūgen** | Japanese | Profound subtlety; suggest rather than state. "Elegant, mysterious beauty beyond words." |
| **Shizen** | Zen | Naturalness; unforced. No fake polish. |
| **Seijaku** | Zen | Tranquility; calm, silence, respite from noise. |
| **Datsuzoku** | Zen | Freedom from cliché; transcend formula. |
| **Wabi-sabi** | Japanese | Imperfection and impermanence as beauty; humble, authentic, not sterile. |

## 3. Feng Shui–Infused UX (Concrete)

- **Energy flow:** Information architecture and navigation should guide users in a clear path; avoid dead ends and broken flows.
- **Commanding position:** Logo, value proposition, and primary nav visible within seconds; no hunting.
- **Spatial awareness:** Layout follows natural eye movement; important elements get breathing room and intuitive position.
- **Declutter:** Remove unnecessary elements, pop-ups, and visual noise so *chi* (attention) can move.
- **Light and calm:** Prefer light, clean backgrounds and soft palettes (e.g. blues, neutrals) unless the brand demands otherwise.
- **Natural elements:** Where it fits, use organic shapes, subtle texture, or nature-inspired imagery for grounding.

---

## 4. Ma (Negative Space) in UI

- **Whitespace-to-content balance:** Generous margins and space between text and images so content can "breathe."
- **Temporality:** Transitions and animations at a human rhythm; use micro-pauses so users can process.
- **Functional minimalism:** Reduce to essential components; every element should earn its place.
- **Rest zones:** Empty space as a place for the eye to rest—avoid dense, exhausting layouts.

---

## 5. Sense of Place (SPIRE-style)

Aim for:

- **Symbolism:** Meaningful, coherent visual language (not random decoration).
- **Purpose:** Every area has a clear role; the page has a clear narrative.
- **Identity:** The space feels like *this* brand/person, not a generic template.
- **Relation:** Layout and tone support how the user relates to the content (trust, curiosity, calm).
- **Emotion:** Design for the target feeling (e.g. calm, credible, bold) through spacing, color, and rhythm.

## 6. Reusable UX Prompt (Copy-Paste)

Use this block when briefing a design, reviewing a page, or prompting an AI to apply these principles.

```
Apply Asian-inspired aesthetic and "sense of place" principles so the page feels right—balanced, calm, and intentional—not generic or noisy.

**Space & rhythm (Ma)**
- Treat negative space as active: generous margins, clear gaps between sections, breathing room around key elements.
- Create a clear visual hierarchy so the eye moves naturally; use spacing to separate ideas, not only borders or boxes.
- Allow "rest zones"—areas of quiet so the layout never feels exhausting.

**Flow & balance (Feng Shui, Yin–Yang)**
- Ensure clear information flow: no dead ends, logical next steps, primary actions in a "commanding position" (visible without hunting).
- Balance aesthetics and function: the page should be beautiful and usable; neither sterile nor chaotic.
- Prefer vertical rhythm that suggests progression (e.g. scroll path) where appropriate.
- Optional: balance 2–3 elemental qualities in palette and shape (e.g. Water + Metal = blues/grays, calm clarity; Wood = growth, green; Earth = grounding, warm neutrals).

**Restraint & subtlety (Kanso, Shibui, Yūgen)**
- Simplify: remove non-essential elements so the essential has power; avoid clutter and decoration for its own sake.
- Prefer understated beauty: muted palettes, elegant typography (considered scale, line-height, and letter-spacing—typography carries rhythm and calm), suggestion over shouting.
- Evoke mood through atmosphere (light, spacing, pacing), not through excess detail or loud CTAs unless the brand demands it.

**Naturalness & calm (Shizen, Seijaku, wabi-sabi)**
- Design for naturalness: layouts that feel unforced, with optional subtle asymmetry (Fukinsei) rather than rigid grids where it helps.
- Aim for tranquility: reduce visual and cognitive noise; the page should feel like a place users want to be, not escape from.
- Avoid sterile perfection; allow a human, authentic feel where it supports the brand.

**Sense of place**
- The page should feel like a distinct *place*: coherent symbolism, clear purpose, and an identity that matches the brand.
- Consider emotion: what should the user feel (calm, trusted, inspired)? Align spacing, color, and rhythm to that.

**Typography & rhythm**
- Use type as a carrier of rhythm and calm: consistent scale, comfortable line-height, and intentional letter-spacing so blocks of text feel like breath, not walls.

**Accessibility**
- "Calm" and "muted" must not compromise legibility. Meet contrast requirements (WCAG); ensure focus states and interactive elements remain clear.

**Asymmetry (Fukinsei) in practice**
- Use off-center focal points, uneven but balanced columns, or one strong visual weight countered by space so the layout feels alive, not templated.

Check: Does the result feel "right"—balanced, clear, and grounded—rather than busy, generic, or overwhelming?

## 7. Critical Gaps & Considerations

A critical pass on what the doc underplays or omits:

| Gap | Why it matters |
|-----|----------------|
| **Cultural scope** | The principles are mostly **East Asian** (Chinese Feng Shui, Japanese Ma / Zen / wabi-sabi / yūgen). Korean design (simplicity, balance, typography-driven, emotional depth) aligns but isn’t named. South and Southeast Asian design traditions are not covered. Use the prompt as *Asian-inspired*, not as a claim to represent “all Asian” aesthetics. |
| **Typography** | Calligraphy and character spacing are central in East Asian visual culture. The doc now calls out typography in the prompt (scale, line-height, letter-spacing) but could go further: type scale as rhythm, one or two families max, and type doing the work that decoration might otherwise do. |
| **Five elements (Feng Shui)** | Wood (green, growth), Fire (red/orange, energy), Earth (browns, grounding), Metal (grays, clarity), Water (blue, calm) can guide color and shape balance. The research mentioned it; the prompt didn’t. Optional add: “Consider balancing 2–3 elemental qualities (e.g. Water + Metal for calm clarity) in palette and shape.” |
| **Accessibility** | Restraint and muted palettes can hurt contrast and focus visibility. The prompt now includes a line that calm/muted must not compromise legibility and that WCAG and focus states matter. |
| **Density vs. minimalism** | Some Asian markets (e.g. many Japanese commercial sites) use **dense** layouts as a signal of trust and value. “Sense of place” for a calm portfolio ≠ sense of place for a information-rich B2B or e‑commerce context. The prompt is tuned for calm, clear experiences; for dense UIs, treat Ma as rhythm within density (rest zones, clear hierarchy) rather than maximum whitespace. |
| **Motion and pacing** | Ma applies to *time* as well as space (tea ceremony, Noh). The doc mentions “transitions at human rhythm” but doesn’t spell out: duration (e.g. 200–400 ms for micro-interactions), easing (ease-out for exits), or loading/empty states as part of the rhythm. Worth specifying when briefing motion. |
| **Proportion systems** | Western design often uses golden ratio or rule of thirds. East Asian traditions use other proportion systems (e.g. in architecture and layout). The doc doesn’t prescribe one; for “feels right,” consider a simple modular scale (e.g. 1.25 or 1.5) for spacing and type so the page has a coherent mathematical rhythm. |
| **Layering and depth** | Yūgen and traditional painting use depth (mist, foreground, distance). In UI: subtle elevation, overlap, or parallax can support “suggestion” and atmosphere. Not in the prompt; add only if the design system allows. |
| **Respectful application** | The style guide author is not Asian; these principles are adopted as best practice, not cultural claim. Use them as **inspiration and framework**. Avoid packaging the result as “authentic” Asian design; “Asian-inspired” or “informed by Eastern aesthetic principles” is more accurate. |
| **Checklist before ship** | The prompt is principle-led. For a quick pass, add: one clear focal point per section, contrast and focus states checked, typography scale consistent, no dead-end flows, and at least one intentional “rest zone” per viewport. |
