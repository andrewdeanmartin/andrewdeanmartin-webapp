## About Section (2,487 characters)

I'm the person teams call when AI ambition collides with delivery reality: unclear scope, legacy systems, compliance constraints, and a deadline that won't move. I help leaders turn "we should use AI" into a buildable plan, a prototype people can react to, and a governed product that can ship.

I'm a Director in PwC Advisory's Commercial Technology & Innovation group, operating at the intersection of consulting leadership, product strategy, and hands-on engineering. That means I can move fluidly from executive narrative → roadmap → architecture → delivery mechanics—often in the same week.

**What sets me apart:**

I don't just manage delivery—I personally build. Recent work includes designing agentic delivery accelerators that orchestrate multiple AI agents through human-in-the-loop workflows, generating SDLC artifacts (user stories, test cases, compliance validation) with full traceability. I've compressed weeks of migration analysis into hours using multi-agent pipelines and built interactive prototypes that unblock investment decisions within days.

I also get deep into the details: AI-augmented codebase assessments, CI/CD pipeline troubleshooting, Azure architecture, React/Python stacks, and platform governance. "AI that works" has to survive real-world security reviews, compliance gates, and operational readiness.

**My impact shows up in three ways:**
- **Speed-to-insight**: Compressing discovery and analysis cycles dramatically
- **Quality & consistency**: Standardized, repeatable outputs instead of bespoke heroics  
- **Risk-managed scale**: Security, governance, and operational readiness that let solutions move from pilot to production

I also invest heavily in building the operating system around the work—investment storytelling, cross-team coordination, and practical enablement so adoption actually happens. I've led AI Champions programs, run Cursor/AI tooling enablement sessions, and created prompt libraries that teams use daily.

**What excites me next:** Building AI-native delivery systems that make great teams faster—agentic workflows, AI governance-by-design, and modernization programs where reliability and compliance matter as much as innovation.

If you're working on GenAI products, agent platforms, enterprise modernization, or technology leadership in consulting, I'd love to compare notes.
