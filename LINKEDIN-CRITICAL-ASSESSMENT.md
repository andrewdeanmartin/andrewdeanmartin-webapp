# Andrew Martin — LinkedIn Critical Assessment

> Written from the perspective of a senior executive recruiter running a Director/VP-level search, cross-referenced against six buyer personas and the brand work we've built together.

---

## The Uncomfortable Summary

Andrew, I'm going to be straight with you. You're a Director at PwC who has built multi-agent pipelines, shipped 10+ POCs, expanded a product into 4 countries in 6 months, created PwC's first B2B2B data reseller model, and led an AI Champions program. That's a genuinely impressive body of work that most people at your level can't match.

**And almost none of it is visible to anyone who isn't already in a meeting with you.**

Your LinkedIn profile — the single most important surface for your professional brand — is essentially invisible. And the few signals that are visible are working against you. Here's the evidence.

---

## Finding 1: You Don't Exist in Search

I searched Google for:
- `"Andrew Dean Martin" PwC LinkedIn`
- `"Andrew Dean Martin" PwC Director "Commercial Technology"`
- `andrewdeanmartin linkedin PwC`

**Zero results returned for you.** Not a single one. Other Andrews at PwC show up. You don't.

### What this means for each persona:

| Persona | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| **The Partner (David)** | If someone internally references you and David Googles your name, he finds nothing. That's not disqualifying inside PwC (he'd use the internal directory), but it's a missed opportunity for reinforcement. |
| **The C-Suite Buyer (Sarah)** | If Sarah's team is evaluating the PwC proposal and Googles the named delivery lead, she finds nothing. In a world where 85% of buyers check online presence before engaging, you're a blank page. That creates doubt. |
| **The Recruiter (Rachel)** | This is the critical failure. Rachel's primary tool is search. If your name + PwC + AI doesn't surface you, you literally don't enter her pipeline. You are invisible to every inbound opportunity that starts with a search — and most of them do. |
| **The Alliance Partner (Marcus)** | Marcus searches "PwC + Salesforce + AI Director" or similar. You don't appear. He finds someone else. |
| **The Internal Sponsor (Vikas/Ian)** | Less impacted (they know you), but if a promotion committee member Googles you and sees nothing, it's a subtle negative signal about external brand maturity. |
| **The Technical Peer (Priya)** | She Googles you before the first meeting. Nothing comes up. She forms no impression, which is better than a bad one, but worse than a good one. |

**Root cause:** Low search visibility is a combination of: (1) no personal website indexed with your full name + role, (2) LinkedIn profile likely not optimized with searchable keywords in headline/about, and (3) no original content (posts, articles) that search engines can index with your name attached.

## Finding 2: Your Activity Layer Says "Observer"

What I could pull from your public LinkedIn:

**Recent activity — all "Liked by":**
- Vikas Agarwal's PwC CT&I hiring post
- WSU Cougar content (multiple)
- A friend's LinkedIn internship announcement
- A PwC/49ers partnership post
- Patrick Parodi's post about physical AI

**Original posts visible: Zero.**
**Comments visible: Zero.**
**Articles visible: Zero.**
**Shared content with added perspective: Zero.**

### What this means:

Your brand system says: *"I ship while others discuss."* Your LinkedIn says: you watch while others post. The dissonance is severe.

| Persona | What they see | What they think |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **The Partner (David)** | Likes on PwC posts but no original content | "Is he a contributor or just staff?" |
| **The C-Suite Buyer (Sarah)** | No evidence of thought leadership | "He might be good but there's no public proof" |
| **The Recruiter (Rachel)** | No posts, no articles, no engagement signal | "Profile is thin; he may not be actively positioned" — she moves to the next tab |
| **The Alliance Partner (Marcus)** | No content about platforms, AI, or co-delivery | Invisible to Marcus entirely |
| **The Internal Sponsor (Vikas/Ian)** | Vikas can see you liked his post but didn't engage further | Missed moment — a thoughtful comment or repost with your perspective would have been visible to Vikas's entire network |
| **The Technical Peer (Priya)** | Nothing technical to evaluate | No opinion formed — neutral at best |

**The particularly painful miss:** You *liked* Vikas Agarwal's post about PwC CT&I hiring. That's your team. Your boss (or peer). The exact work you do. And you responded with a like — not a comment saying "this is the team I lead, here's what we're building," not a repost saying "I'm on this team and here's what excites me about the work." That was a free, high-visibility moment to signal your brand to Vikas's entire network, and it evaporated.

## Finding 3: Your Only Visible Recommendation Is From 2007

The one recommendation that surfaced publicly:

> *"Andrew is a very hard working individual. He will do whatever is necessary to reach his goals. Andrew does a great job at working and speaking with co-workers. I would highly recommend Andrew for any leadership position."* — Colin Finn

### The problem:

This reads like an early-career recommendation — generic, vague, and from a period when you were a fraternity leadership consultant or HP sales rep. There's nothing wrong with Colin Finn or the recommendation itself. But when it's the **only visible endorsement** on a Director's profile, it creates a contrast problem.

| What it says | What a recruiter hears |
|-------------|----------------------|
| "Very hard working individual" | Entry-level descriptor. Not Director-level language. |
| "Will do whatever is necessary" | Generalist praise, not role-specific. |
| "Working and speaking with co-workers" | This is a baseline expectation, not a differentiator. |
| "Any leadership position" | So broad it's meaningless at your level. |

A recruiter running a VP/Director search expects to see recommendations from **Partners, clients, or senior peers** that reference **specific outcomes, leadership moments, or technical credibility.** Something like: *"Andrew built a prototype in 3 days that unlocked a $2M pursuit. He's one of the few Directors I'd put in front of a client CTO unsupervised."*

You likely have more recommendations on your profile that I couldn't see — LinkedIn restricts access. But the one that *is* public is doing you harm by being the only visible data point.

## Finding 4: Your Organization Section Features DU, Not PwC

The only organization that surfaced publicly:

> **Board Director at Delta Upsilon International Fraternity**

This is a real and respectable commitment. But when it's the **only organizational affiliation visible** to a public viewer (no PwC, no industry associations, no advisory boards), it creates an imbalanced impression.

For the Partner (David) and the C-Suite Buyer (Sarah), the first organizational signal is a fraternity board — not PwC, not a technology organization, not an AI consortium. That's fine as a secondary detail, but as the *lead* signal, it undermines positioning.

## Finding 5: The Drafted Content Is Strong But Likely Not Live

Your `LINKEDIN-PROFILE.md` file contains excellent headline options, a well-written About section, and solid experience bullets. The question I can't answer from outside: **Is any of this actually published on your LinkedIn profile?**

If the answer is yes — the content is good but the surrounding signals (activity, recommendations, search visibility) are drowning it out.

If the answer is no — you have a fully drafted Director-level profile sitting in a markdown file while your live LinkedIn tells a different story.

### The drafted content assessed honestly:

**Headline options — all three are strong.** Option 1 ("Director at PwC | AI Delivery & Digital Transformation | Turning Strategy into Shipped Products") is the best balance of searchability, specificity, and differentiation. It would perform well for Rachel the recruiter's Boolean search.

**About section — genuinely good.** The opening line ("I'm the person teams call when AI ambition collides with delivery reality") is one of the best About openers I've seen at this level. It's specific, it's vivid, and it passes the "retellable" test for every persona. The structure (what sets me apart → impact → what's next → invitation) follows a sound framework.

**Experience bullets — current role is excellent; previous roles are thin.** The Director/CT&I bullets are specific, metric-driven, and scannable. But the Platform Engagement Lead, Product Portfolio Lead, and GM roles have generic bullets ("Managed portfolio," "Coordinated development lifecycle," "Drove adoption") that could be on anyone's profile. These earlier PwC roles are where you did meaningful work (Workplace GTM, Workforce Orchestrator P&L, ESG expansion) — they deserve the same specificity as your current role.

**What's missing entirely from the draft:**
- HP experience (Colorado Springs → Boston, SLED sales, how you found PwC)
- Delta Upsilon leadership consultant role (the origin story — 30+ chapters, self-starter formation)
- MBA / Eaton Shanghai internship
- Any mention of SharpPrompt, PromptEngine, SharpAsk, or your whitepapers
- Featured section strategy (LinkedIn lets you pin posts, articles, links, media)
- Recommendations strategy
- Content/posting approach

## Persona-by-Persona Scorecard

Scoring: How well does your current LinkedIn presence serve each persona? (1 = actively harmful, 5 = fully optimized)

| Persona | Score | Assessment |
|---------|-------|------------|
| **The Partner (David)** | 2/5 | The drafted About/Experience content would score 4/5 if live. But no activity, no visible proof, and no retellable content means David can't use you in a conversation unless he already knows you personally. |
| **The C-Suite Buyer (Sarah)** | 1/5 | Sarah Googles you and finds nothing. If she reaches your LinkedIn, she sees likes on sports content and a fraternity board. No artifacts, no governance language, no prototype evidence. She moves on. |
| **The Recruiter (Rachel)** | 2/5 | If she finds your profile through LinkedIn search (not Google, which fails), the headline and About *might* be strong enough — IF they're published. But no recommendations from senior people, no content, no featured section = she puts you in "maybe" pile, not "must present." |
| **The Alliance Partner (Marcus)** | 1/5 | Zero platform-specific content. No posts about Salesforce, Agentforce, Zoom, or any partner technology. Marcus has no way to find you and no reason to reach out if he did. |
| **The Internal Sponsor (Vikas/Ian)** | 3/5 | They know your work directly, so LinkedIn matters less. But the lack of external brand signals missed maturity to a promotion committee. Liking Vikas's post instead of engaging substantively was a missed multiplier moment. |
| **The Technical Peer (Priya)** | 2/5 | No GitHub link visible, no technical content, no evidence of tools or code. Your SharpPrompt extension, PromptEngine, and SharpAsk exist but are invisible. Priya sees a management profile, not a builder. |

**Overall: 1.8 / 5**

## Does "LinkedIn + Standalone Website" Make Sense?

Now, putting on my senior recruiter hat to answer your actual question:

### Yes. This is the right two-surface strategy. Here's why.

**LinkedIn is your discovery layer.** It's where 90% of professional encounters start. Boolean searches, referral follow-ups, post-meeting profile checks — all LinkedIn. Your profile needs to be airtight: headline, About, Experience, Featured, Recommendations. This is non-negotiable and should be done first.

**A standalone website is your depth and ownership layer.** It serves four purposes LinkedIn can't:

1. **Google presence.** Your site will rank for "Andrew Martin AI PwC" within weeks. Right now that search returns nothing. A well-structured site with your name, title, and keywords in the right places fixes this.

2. **Artifacts and proof.** LinkedIn has limited ability to show your work. A site can embed screenshots, diagrams, methodology visuals, project summaries — the proof layer that every persona needs and LinkedIn can't provide.

3. **Narrative control.** LinkedIn's format forces you into a chronological, role-based structure. A site lets you lead with your superpower, show your process, and tell your story the way *you* want it told — starting in Vancouver, WA, not at PwC.

4. **Permanence.** LinkedIn can change its algorithm, visibility rules, or format at any time. Your site is yours. It's the asset you own.

### The relationship between the two:

LinkedIn is the **storefront window** — clean, scannable, optimized for the 30-second scan. Every persona starts here.

The website is the **workshop with the door open** — where people go when they want more. Your site link lives in your LinkedIn contact info, your email signature, and your bio in every PwC proposal. It's the "if you want to see what I actually build, go here" destination.

### What doesn't make sense:

- Building the website *before* fixing LinkedIn. LinkedIn reaches more of your personas more often. Fix it first.
- Treating the website as a replacement for LinkedIn activity. You still need to post, comment, and engage. The site is for depth; LinkedIn is for frequency and visibility.
- Building either without the brand system and personas as the filter. You now have the principles. Every word, every section, every design choice should pass through them.

### Recommended sequence:

1. **LinkedIn audit and update** (headline, About, Experience, Featured section, banner image, recommendations solicitation) — this week
2. **LinkedIn content plan** (3–4 structured posts based on real work, scheduled over 2–3 weeks) — starts immediately after
3. **Website rebuild** (using brand system, informed by personas, proof-led) — parallel or fast-follow
4. **Cross-link everything** (site URL on LinkedIn, LinkedIn on site, both in email signature)

## The Bottom Line

You have a Director-level career with genuine, differentiated impact — and an entry-level online presence. The work is real. The brand is invisible. Every persona who matters to your future — the Partner with the pursuit, the CDO with the budget, the recruiter with the search, the alliance lead with the pipeline — they're all checking, and right now they're finding almost nothing.

The good news: the raw material is excellent. Your drafted LinkedIn content is strong. Your brand system is clear. Your personas are defined. You know who you're speaking to and what they need. The gap isn't substance. It's *visibility.*

The fix isn't hard. It's just work. And you're the person who does the work.
