# Goal Confirmation: Research-Backed

## The Goal (Confirmed)

**A portfolio that looks excellent and tells your story to help you land your next job.**

No award pursuit. No category-creation. Just: effective job-search tool that represents you well.

## What the Research Confirms

### 1. Personal Websites Work for Executives

- Recruiters and hiring managers routinely search online for social proof beyond LinkedIn.[1]
- A well-designed personal site = you take your career seriously, you control the narrative, you differentiate from candidates without one.[2][3]
- For directors leaving Big 4: "You become the brand." At PwC, the institution opens doors. In your next chapter, *you* open them. Personal reputation, network, and a clear value proposition matter.[4][5]

### 2. The Window Is 12–20 Seconds

A VP of Design was observed reviewing portfolios: **12 seconds per tab**. Then close. Gone.[6]

Resume studies: recruiters spend **7–11 seconds** on initial scan; if you pass, they dig deeper (median 1.5 min total).[7]

**Implication:** Your homepage must answer three questions in under 20 seconds:
- **Competence:** Can this person solve my problem?
- **Trust:** Do I believe what they're claiming?
- **Fit:** Will they understand my situation?[6]

If the answer isn't obvious, you're closed.

### 3. What Recruiters and Hiring Managers Look For (Executive Level)

- **Who are you as a leader?** Clear identity, not "open to anything."
- **What business problems do you solve?** Specific, not vague.
- **What results do you consistently deliver?** Quantifiable.[8][9]
- **Executive Value Proposition:** What you improve, protect, accelerate, transform. Articulated clearly so you don't get filtered out.[10]

### 4. The 6 Elements That Actually Convert (UX Playbook — Transferable to Exec Portfolios)

| Element | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **1. Clear navigation + CTA** | No creative menu labels. "About," "See How I Work," "Connect" — obvious. Primary CTA within one click. |
| **2. Unique one-liner** | Not "I create great experiences" or "passionate about AI." Format: *I help [target] achieve [result] through [method].* |
| **3. Strategic CTA** | Action-oriented: "Book a Call," "See My Work," "Let's Chat." Not "Explore" or "Discover." |
| **4. Social proof** | Logos, testimonials, impact metrics. Specific > generic. "90% reduction" beats "improved efficiency." |
| **5. Best work** | Quality over quantity. Lead with outcomes. "The Challenge → The Impact → The Process." |
| **6. Footer + CTA** | Last chance to convert. Clear contact, availability, one more nudge. |

### 5. Positioning Statement Framework

**Formula:** *I help [target] achieve [result] through [method].*

**The Uber Test:** Explain what you do in one sentence before you reach your destination. If you can't, your positioning needs work.[6]

**The Competitor Check:** If your positioning could apply to 10 other people, get more specific.[6]

## How Your Current Site Maps to This

### What’s Working

| Element | Current State |
|---------|---------------|
| **One-liner** | "Turning AI Ambition into Shipped Products" — specific, memorable. |
| **Opening line** | "I'm the person teams call when AI ambition collides with delivery reality..." — strong voice, clear. |
| **CTAs** | "See It In Action" → demos; "Connect" → contact. Action-oriented. |
| **Proof** | Agent pipeline, SharpPrompt, codebase assessment — working demos, not slides. |
| **Impact metrics** | 90% reduction, 4 territories, 10+ POCs — quantifiable. |
| **Navigation** | About, What I Do, Demos, Impact, Journey, Connect — clear, no jargon. |

### Gaps or Risks

| Gap | Research Says |
|-----|---------------|
| **12-second test** | Unclear if a stranger instantly gets: who you are, what you solve, why they should care. The hero has a lot of text; scan-ability matters. |
| **Testimonials** | No visible quotes from colleagues, clients, or leaders. Social proof is "trust currency" — one specific testimonial beats five generic.[6] |
| **Positioning formula** | "I help [target] achieve [result] through [method]" — your copy implies it but doesn't state it as clearly. Could sharpen. |
| **Footer CTA** | Does the footer have a clear final nudge, or is it just copyright? |
| **Primary CTA hierarchy** | Is "See It In Action" the most visually prominent element after your name? Research says it should be.[6] |

### Audience Clarity

Research emphasizes: **Be specific about who you want to hire you.**

- "SaaS product managers at Series A startups" > "companies"
- "PwC Partners evaluating CT&I leaders" > "executives"
- "Recruiters filling VP AI Delivery roles" > "recruiters"

If you haven't named the target, the copy may drift toward generic.

## Confirmed Priorities (Refined)

1. **Clarity in 12 seconds** — Hero and above-the-fold must answer: Who, What, Why. Fast.
2. **Positioning sharpness** — Explicit value prop: I help [X] achieve [Y] through [Z].
3. **Social proof** — At least one testimonial or quote with a name and specific result.
4. **Visual excellence** — Looks excellent = professional credibility. Research says well-designed sites signal you take your career seriously.[2]
5. **Story** — Your journey, capabilities, and demos should flow as a narrative. "Tells your story" = coherent, memorable, leaves them wanting more.
6. **Conversion path** — Clear CTAs, easy contact, no dead ends.
