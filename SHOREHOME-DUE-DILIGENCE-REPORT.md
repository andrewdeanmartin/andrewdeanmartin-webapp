# Commercial Due Diligence Report: ShoreHome

**Target:** ShoreHome | Sarasota, Florida | Home Improvement (Roofing & Outdoor Living)  
**Report Date:** February 19, 2026  
**Framework:** PwC-Grade Full Diligence (Desk Research + Primary Research Gaps Flagged)

---

## Executive Summary

ShoreHome presents as a **local, licensed roofing and outdoor living contractor** serving Sarasota, Manatee, and Charlotte Counties with a broad service mix (roofing—shingle, tile, metal—plus pool/patio pavers, screen enclosures, outdoor kitchens, pool restoration, fire pits). The business appears **operationally active and marketing-focused**, with a modern website, blog, and stated differentiators (quality materials, warranties, local focus). **Critical gaps remain:** (1) **License verification** — the entity and license number (CBC1267990) cited on the website could not be confirmed in public DBPR search results; unrelated similarly named entities (Shore Homes Co., Shore Roofing, West Shore Home) exist and must be distinguished. (2) **Owner/key person** — no public information on ownership, founding date, or management depth. (3) **Financials and reputation** — no BBB profile located, no PPP hit, no revenue/SDE proxy; review aggregation across Google/Yelp/BBB was not available in search results. **Verdict:** Insufficient data to classify as healthy, at-risk, or distressed. The **single most important factor** is **primary validation of corporate identity and license** (Sunbiz + DBPR + owner interview). The **one action** that would most change the risk profile is **obtaining verified P&L, tax returns, and lease/real estate terms** and **conducting 3–5 customer and 2+ local professional reference checks**.

**Adversarial check:**

None are the same as ShoreHome, LLC. **Primary:** Confirm no prior trading names, prior entities, or shared principals with negative history.

**Confidence:** High (entity and license verified via Sunbiz and Florida DBPR).  
**Risk flag:** None — entity active; license current and tied to John Dale Ross (primary) and SHOREHOME LLC (DBA).

**Addendum (follow-up research):** **Entity confirmed via Florida Sunbiz.** SHOREHOME LLC — Document # L24000391788, EIN 39-4344375, **filed 09/09/2024** (effective 09/07/2024), Status **ACTIVE**.

No complaints or discipline visible in search result; click-through on DBPR recommended for full discipline history. *UCC search not run at source (requires direct search at floridaucc.com).*

---

## Section 2 — Owner & Key Person Risk

- **Owner identity:** Not identified in public search. Website does not name founder or owner.
- **Background, prior ventures, reputation:** No public record found. No court or licensing disciplinary hits in search for “ShoreHome” + Sarasota.
- **Key person dependency:** Unknown. No GM, operations lead, or second-in-command named; business appears owner-centric by narrative (“family owned,” “local”).
- **Management bench:** Not disclosed. **Primary:** Identify successor or key operator if owner unavailable.
- **Owner motivation (sell/step back/partner):** Not applicable to this desk review; **primary** if transaction is contemplated.
- **Succession / documentation:** No evidence of documented processes or transition planning in public materials.

**Primary research required:**  
- Interview owner; confirm name, background, and tenure.  
- Two+ local professional references (e.g., suppliers, other contractors, chamber).  
- Court and state licensing board search for owner name(s) and any disciplinary history.

**Addendum (follow-up):** Sunbiz lists **authorized persons (managers):** John Ross and Dustyn McCauley. **DBPR confirms John Dale Ross** as the **qualifying individual (primary)** on contractor license CBC1267990 — i.e., the licensed professional behind SHOREHOME LLC. Equity ownership and exact role of Dustyn McCauley still not disclosed. Court search on both names still recommended.

**Confidence:** Medium (qualifying individual identified; ownership/equity and McCauley’s role not confirmed).  
**Risk flag:** Watch — key-person dependency on Ross for license; bench and succession still unverified.

---

## Section 3 — Market Position & Competitive Landscape

- **Segment:** Residential (and implied light commercial) homeowners in Sarasota, Manatee, and Charlotte Counties seeking roofing and outdoor living (pavers, pools, enclosures, outdoor kitchens, fire pits).
- **Competitors (desk):** Multiple established players in the same geography: Roofing by Curry (Sarasota, 30+ years, GAF Master Elite, BBB, strong reviews); Kingdom Roofing (Venice, father-son, 2017); Suncoast Builders & Roofing; New Wave Roofing LLC; Ferguson Roofing; Competitive Roofing FL; Mighty Dog Roofing (Lakewood Ranch); AKVM (GAF-certified, Bradenton-Sarasota). GAF lists certified contractors in Sarasota. **Primary:** Map 5- and 10-mile density and recent openings/closures.
- **Indirect/digital:** National and regional chains, lead-gen platforms, and manufacturer-certified networks compete for same wallet.
- **Differentiation (claimed):** “Cutting-edge” roofing; quality materials; durability; warranties; “Innovative & Quality Driven”; “Reliable & Trustworthy”; “Local & Customer Focused”; “Licensed & Insured.” Duration® shingles and specific tile lines (Sanibel, Tuscany, Windsor) called out.
- **Substantiation:** No comparative pricing, review volume, or third-party awards found for ShoreHome. Competitors such as Roofing by Curry show GAF Master Elite, BBB, and local “#1” recognition. **Adversarial:** Moat is unproven; a well-capitalized entrant with GAF certification and strong local marketing could replicate position in 12 months; differentiation is largely narrative until reviews and retention data are reviewed.
- **Market share:** Not estimated; no proxy (review count, job volume, employees) available.

**Confidence:** Medium (competitive set identified; ShoreHome’s relative position not).  
**Risk flag:** Watch — differentiation and share need primary validation.

---

## Section 4 — Financial Health & Cash Flow Analysis

- **Revenue estimation:** No employee count, location size, or disclosed revenue. Industry benchmarks (e.g., IBISWorld, RMA) can be applied once size is known. **Primary:** Request P&L and tax returns.
- **Margin structure:** Not known. Typical drivers for roofing/outdoor living: labor, materials, subs, occupancy, marketing. **Primary:** Understand COGS, labor, and overhead.
- **Cash flow:** Unknown. Working capital cycle (deposits, progress billing, net terms with suppliers) not visible. Seasonal and storm-driven spikes can create timing gaps.
- **Debt / PPP:** No PPP loan found for “ShoreHome” in search. UCC search completed (one filing; see addendum). **Primary:** Run Florida UCC search (floridaucc.com) for “ShoreHome LLC”; review any debt and covenants.
- **Pricing:** Not compared. Website emphasizes quality and value, not discount. **Primary:** Compare to Roofing by Curry and 2–3 others on like-for-like scope.
- **Stress signals:** No ownership changes, shortened hours, or asset sales identified. Site and content appear current (e.g., blog, 2026 footer). **Adversarial:** Strong top-line narrative does not prove cash-flow health; lease, payables, and growth funding need verification.

**Addendum — UCC filing (02/2026):** One UCC1 financing statement on file. **Filing #** 202503811777. **Filed** 10/04/2025; **expires** 10/04/2030. **Secured party:** Kubota Credit Corporation, U.S.A. (Grapevine, TX). **Debtors:** SHORE HOME LLC and ROSS, JOHN DALE (both 320 26th St W, Bradenton, FL 34205). **Collateral (from UCC1 form):** (1) **Kubota SVL75-3** (skid-steer loader), serial/ID refs on file; (2) **Land Pride AP-HD74** (attachment, 74″; ref LLC2380002); (3) **Land Pride AP-PFL56** (48″ 5,500 lb pallet fork). Land Pride is a Kubota brand. John Dale Ross is co-debtor (personal obligation or guarantee). **Address note:** UCC lists 320 **26th** St **W**; Sunbiz/DBPR list 320 **29th** St **NW** — confirm whether two locations or filing variance. **Primary:** Obtain payoff amount and payment terms; confirm no other UCCs or liens.

**Confidence:** Low.  
**Risk flag:** Red — no financials reviewed.

---

## Section 5 — Lease & Physical Asset Analysis

- **Lease term / renewal:** Unknown. No address or landlord disclosed.
- **Rent vs. market:** N/A until location and terms known.
- **Landlord / redevelopment / zoning:** Unknown. **Primary:** Obtain lease and confirm property outlook.
- **Lease type (triple-net vs. gross):** Unknown.
- **Condition of space / CapEx:** Not observed. **Primary:** Site visit and list of owned vs. leased equipment and any encumbrances.
- **Equipment encumbrance:** One UCC1 on file — Kubota Credit Corp. (filed 10/04/2025, exp. 10/04/2030); debtors SHORE HOME LLC and John Dale Ross. **Collateral:** Kubota SVL75-3 skid steer, Land Pride AP-HD74 attachment, Land Pride AP-PFL56 48″ 5,500 lb pallet fork (Section 4 addendum). Obtain payoff.
- **Adversarial:** Real estate can be the main risk; 18 months left in a hot corridor vs. 7 years at below-market rent materially affects risk profile.

**Confidence:** Low.  
**Risk flag:** Red — lease and premises not reviewed.

---

## Section 6 — Customer Concentration & Revenue Quality

- **Revenue distribution:** Unknown. No disclosure of top customers or referral sources.
- **Recurring vs. transactional:** Roofing and outdoor living are predominantly project-based; recurring revenue (e.g., maintenance contracts) not stated. **Primary:** Ask % from repeat vs. new and any recurring programs.
- **Anchor / foot traffic:** N/A (contractor, not retail).
- **Platform dependency:** Revenue does not appear to flow through delivery or booking platforms; lead sources (Google, Houzz, referral, paid) unknown. **Primary:** Understand % of jobs from each channel and whether any single channel is critical.
- **Customer data:** Website has contact form and phone; no indication that customer list is locked in a platform. **Primary:** Confirm CRM and list ownership.
- **Contracts / subscriptions:** Not applicable in a typical sense; **primary:** confirm any maintenance or warranty programs that create stickiness.

**Confidence:** Low.  
**Risk flag:** Watch — concentration and platform dependency unquantified.

---

## Section 7 — Operational Assessment

- **Hours / availability:** Not stated (typical for contractor; “Free Estimates” and phone emphasized). **Primary:** Call as prospect and measure responsiveness.
- **Staffing:** No job postings or Glassdoor/Indeed reviews attributed to ShoreHome in search. No turnover or understaffing signals. **Primary:** Confirm headcount, key roles, and any open roles.
- **Technology:** Modern, responsive site (shorehome.co); blog; contact form; single phone number. No POS or scheduling tool visible. Developer credit: “MediaFocusDesigns” (website development & hosting). **Primary:** Identify scheduling, CRM, and back-office systems.
- **Supply chain:** Not disclosed. **Primary:** Identify key suppliers, single-source risks, and material cost exposure.
- **Capacity:** Not observed. **Primary:** Site visit and discussion of backlog and capacity.
- **Process documentation:** Not visible. **Primary:** Assess whether operations are systematized or tribal.

**Primary research required:** Visit or call as customer; observe responsiveness, demeanor, and any facility if applicable.

**Confidence:** Low.  
**Risk flag:** Watch — operations not observed.

## Section 8 — Reputation & Customer Sentiment

### 8A. Platform-by-Platform Review Footprint (Deep Research, 02/19/2026)

| # | Platform | Found? | Stars | Reviews | Notes |
|---|----------|--------|-------|---------|-------|
| 1 | **Google Business Profile / Maps** | **NO** | — | 0 | Searched "ShoreHome roofing Bradenton," "ShoreHome outdoor living Sarasota," phone (941) 725-4344. No GBP listing exists. |
| 2 | **Yelp** | **NO** | — | 0 | No Yelp listing for ShoreHome in Sarasota/Bradenton. |
| 3 | **Facebook** | **UNCONFIRMED** | — | — | facebook.com/shorehomes, /ShoreHomeSolutions, /shorehomerepairsllc found but all login-gated. None confirmed as tied to shorehome.co / SHOREHOME LLC. **Primary:** Log in and verify. |
| 4 | **Instagram** | **POSSIBLE** | — | — | @shore_homes exists but inaccessible (403). Cannot confirm tied to shorehome.co. May belong to Shore Homes Co. (St. Pete). **Primary:** Visit profile. |
| 5 | **Houzz** | **NO (this entity)** | — | 0 | No listing for ShoreHome LLC in Bradenton/Sarasota. **Shore Homes Co.** (St. Pete, CGC1522223) has a Houzz profile (5.0 stars) — **DIFFERENT entity** (see 8C). |
| 6 | **Nextdoor** | **NO** | — | 0 | Top recommended roofers in area: SonShine Roofing, Dream Team Roofing, Charlie Rice Roofing, 2nd Gen Roofing. ShoreHome absent. |
| 7 | **Angi / HomeAdvisor** | **NO** | — | 0 | No dedicated ShoreHome profile on either platform. |
| 8 | **BBB** | **NO** | — | 0 | No BBB profile for ShoreHome LLC or shorehome.co. West Shore Home (Pinellas Park) has BBB A+ — unrelated. |
| 9 | **Birdeye** | **DIFFERENT ENTITY** | 4.8 | 59 | "Shore Home Construction" on Birdeye is in **Salisbury, MD**. Completely unrelated. |
| 10 | **BuildZoom / Thumbtack / Porch** | **NO** | — | 0 | No listings for ShoreHome LLC on any of these. |
| 11 | **General Google search** | **NO REVIEWS** | — | 0 | Searched "ShoreHome review," "ShoreHome roofing review," "Shore Home Bradenton review." Only shorehome.co and unrelated entities returned. Zero customer reviews found on the open web. |

### 8B. Aggregate Assessment

- **Total verified third-party reviews for ShoreHome (shorehome.co / SHOREHOME LLC / CBC1267990): ZERO.**
- **Google Business Profile:** Not created or not claimed. This is the single most important review platform for local contractors — its absence means ShoreHome is invisible in Google Maps “local pack” results, which typically drives 30–50% of inbound leads for home services.
- **Yelp, BBB, Houzz, Nextdoor, Angi, HomeAdvisor:** No listings found on any major review or directory platform.
- **Social media:** Facebook and Instagram accounts with "shorehome" or "shore_homes" handles exist but could not be confirmed as belonging to this entity. Content, followers, and engagement unknown.
- **Trend (12–24 months):** Not analyzable — no review data exists.
- **Positive/negative themes:** Not available — no reviews to analyze.
- **Owner response to reviews:** Not applicable — no reviews found.
- **Website testimonials:** shorehome.co appears JavaScript-rendered and returned minimal content on fetch; any on-site testimonials could not be independently verified.

### 8C. Entity Disambiguation — “Shore” Name Confusion

Multiple similarly-named entities exist. **None are affiliated with ShoreHome (shorehome.co / SHOREHOME LLC / CBC1267990):**

| Entity | License | Location | Relationship? |
|--------|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Shore Homes Co.** (Brandon Miles Shore) | CGC1522223 | St. Petersburg, FL (Pinellas) | **DIFFERENT.** Different owner, license, geography. Houzz: 5.0. Web: shorehomesremodeling.com |
| **Shore Home Remodeling** (Michael Phelan) | Unknown | Sarasota, FL | **DIFFERENT.** 4.9 stars, 50+ reviews. Web: shorehomeremodeling.com. Phone: (941) 961-3362. Different owner, phone, website. |
| **Shore Home Construction** | N/A | Salisbury, MD | **DIFFERENT.** Birdeye: 4.8, 59 reviews. Maryland-based. |
| **Shore Roofing / Shore Roofers Sarasota** | Various | Jax Beach / Sarasota | **DIFFERENT.** Tom Shore (Jax Beach). shorerooferssarasota.com is separate. |
| **West Shore Home** | Various | National (HQ: PA) | **DIFFERENT.** National window/door/bath. BBB A+. |
| **Shore Outdoor Living** | N/A | Delaware/Maryland | **DIFFERENT.** 5.0, 32 Google reviews. Different geography entirely. |

### 8D. Comparison — Shore Home Remodeling (Different Entity, Same Market)

**Shore Home Remodeling** (shorehomeremodeling.com) operates in the overlapping Sarasota geography with a mature review footprint:

| Metric | Shore Home Remodeling | ShoreHome (shorehome.co) |
|--------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| Owner | Michael Phelan | John Dale Ross / Dustyn McCauley |
| Website | shorehomeremodeling.com | shorehome.co |
| Rating | 4.9 / 5.0 | No ratings found |
| Review count | 50+ | 0 |
| BBB | Not found (A+ claimed on site) | Not found |
| Services | Kitchen, bath, whole-home, outdoor kitchens | Roofing, outdoor living, pavers, pools |
| Phone | (941) 961-3362 | (941) 725-4344 |
| Entity relationship | **None identified** | — |

### 8E. Risk Implications

1. **Zero review footprint is a significant red flag** for a contractor marketing itself as established. Comparable competitors (SonShine Roofing, Dream Team Roofing, Roofing by Curry) have dozens to hundreds of reviews.
2. **No Google Business Profile** means ShoreHome is invisible in the most important local discovery channel. This suggests either (a) the business is very new and has not yet built a customer base, (b) reviews exist under a different name or prior entity, or (c) the GBP was never created/claimed.
3. **The entity was incorporated September 2024** (per Sunbiz, Section 1 addendum). A ~17-month operating history could partially explain a thin footprint, but the **complete absence** of any third-party reviews is notable even for a young business.
4. **Name confusion risk:** A buyer or partner could mistakenly attribute Shore Home Remodeling’s 4.9-star / 50+ review reputation to ShoreHome (shorehome.co). These are confirmed different entities with different owners.

**Primary research still required:**
- Log in to Facebook and verify which (if any) page belongs to this entity; check followers, reviews, post history.
- Visit Instagram @shore_homes and confirm identity.
- Mystery-shop: call (941) 725-4344, request a quote, measure responsiveness and follow-up.
- Request 3–5 customer references directly from ownership and conduct interviews.
- Ask ownership: Have they ever had a GBP? Were reviews solicited? Is there a review profile under a different name or prior entity?

**Confidence:** Medium (extensive multi-platform search completed; absence of listings is itself a confirmed finding).  
**Risk flag:** Red — zero verified third-party reviews across all major platforms for a business marketing itself as an established contractor.

---

## Section 9 — Legal, Regulatory & Compliance Exposure

- **Litigation:** No civil suits, judgments, or settlements found for “ShoreHome” or “Shore Home” in Sarasota in search. Unrelated “Shore” cases (e.g., Shore et al. v. 6th Judicial Circuit; West Shore Home v. ELOCAL) noted. **Primary:** Search Sarasota Clerk and state court by business and owner name; PACER if federal.
- **BBB:** No BBB profile found for ShoreHome (Sarasota). West Shore Home (other company) has BBB presence. **Primary:** BBB search by exact name and address.
- **Licensing:** Website states “Licensed & Insured” and “License # CBC1267990.” Florida DBPR license search did not return a direct match for CBC1267990 in results reviewed; CBC prefix is consistent with Certified Building Contractor. **Primary:** Verify CBC1267990 at [MyFloridaLicense.com](https://www.myfloridalicense.com) and confirm entity name and status (active, no discipline).
- **Other regulatory:** No health department, OSHA, NLRB, or environmental flags found. **Primary:** Confirm insurance (general liability, workers’ comp, professional/contractor) and any required trade licenses.
- **Adversarial:** Search owner name(s) with business name in court records; personal judgments can signal behavior even if not attaching to the LLC.

**Confidence:** Low on license (unverified); Medium on litigation (no hits).  
**Risk flag:** Watch — license must be verified; Red if verification fails.

---

## Section 10 — Digital Presence & Platform Dependency

- **Website:** shorehome.co; professional layout; roofing and outdoor living; blog; mobile-friendly; clear CTAs (Free Estimates, phone). No e-commerce. Developer: MediaFocusDesigns.
- **Domain age / SEO:** Not verified via WHOIS in this review. **Primary:** Check domain age, core keyword rankings for “[service] Sarasota,” and page speed.
- **Google Business Profile:** **Confirmed NOT FOUND (02/19/2026).** Extensive search across multiple query variations and phone number returned no GBP listing. ShoreHome does not appear in Google Maps local pack results. This is the single most impactful gap in their digital presence for local lead generation. **Primary:** Ask ownership if GBP was ever created, claimed, or suspended; create and optimize GBP as immediate action item.
- **Paid ads:** Not confirmed. **Primary:** Check branded and category terms for Google/Meta/Yelp spend.
- **Email/SMS / loyalty:** Not evident. **Primary:** Confirm whether they own a direct channel (email/SMS list).
- **Platform dependency:** Visibility appears website- and phone-led; not dependent on a single delivery or booking platform. Risk is search and referral concentration (e.g., Houzz, Google) until measured.

**Confidence:** Medium (site quality observed; GBP confirmed absent; rankings and ads not verified).  
**Risk flag:** Watch → elevated — GBP absence confirmed; SEO rankings and ad spend still need verification.

---

## Section 11 — Seasonality & Stress Testing

- **Seasonality:** Florida roofing and outdoor living are seasonal and event-driven. Hurricane season (Jun–Nov) drives repair/emergency demand; late winter–early spring is often preferred for planned replacements. **Primary:** Obtain monthly or quarterly revenue to quantify peak/trough and working capital needs.
- **Stress scenarios (conceptual):**
  - **Competitive entry:** Strong local entrant (e.g., GAF Master Elite) nearby could take share; impact depends on loyalty and differentiation. **Primary:** Model with owner (pricing, retention).
  - **Platform loss:** No single platform dominates revenue in public narrative; impact likely moderate unless one channel is dominant. **Primary:** Quantify channel mix.
  - **Key person loss:** High risk if owner is the primary relationship and operational driver; no visible bench. **Primary:** Define continuity plan.
  - **Macro (e.g., 20% drop in discretionary spend):** Home improvement can contract; survival depends on margins, reserves, and debt. **Primary:** Stress-test with actual P&L.
  - **Lease non-renewal or +30% rent:** Impact unknown until lease and economics are known.

**Confidence:** Low (no revenue curve).  
**Risk flag:** Watch — seasonality and stress not quantified.

---

## Section 12 — Growth Signals & Strategic Trajectory

- **Expansion / new services:** Website shows broad, current service set and blog content (screen enclosures, pool deck/patio pavers, outdoor kitchens, backyard transformation). No new locations or acquisitions found.
- **Press / awards:** No local press or industry awards found for ShoreHome. Competitors (e.g., Roofing by Curry) have local “#1” and GAF awards.
- **Franchise / scalability:** Not indicated; appears single-market operator.
- **Reinvestment vs. extraction:** Not observable. **Primary:** Discuss CapEx and owner compensation.
- **COVID / inflation response:** Not documented. **Primary:** Ask how they adapted.
- **Pipeline:** Not visible. **Primary:** Ask backlog, waitlists, or advance bookings.

**Confidence:** Low.  
**Risk flag:** None — no negative growth signals; no positive verification.

---

## Section 13 — Macro & Local Market Context

- **Sarasota area:** City population ~57.8k (2024), +5.3% since 2020; median household income ~$70k (2023); unemployment ~3.5% (Oct 2024). County ~479k; real GDP ~$26.2B (2023); housing permits strong (7,466 in 2024). Older demographic (e.g., 29.3% 65+). Sources: Census QuickFacts, BLS, EDR/county profile.
- **Industry:** Home improvement and roofing remain relevant; Florida weather and aging housing support demand. Hurricane events create volatility and demand spikes.
- **Zoning / development:** No specific redevelopment or zoning change identified for this business. **Primary:** Confirm if location is in path of growth or redevelopment.
- **Demographics:** Customer base (homeowners, likely 40+) aligns with county age and income; segment size and growth not quantified.
- **Regulation:** No pending local legislation or licensing reforms identified. **Primary:** Confirm any local contractor or insurance requirements.

**Confidence:** Medium (macro and county data; business-specific context limited).  
**Risk flag:** None.

---

## Section 14 — Valuation & Exit Framework

- **SDE multiple:** Not computed — no SDE. Roofing SDE multiples (recent transaction data) average ~3.06x (range ~1.61x–4.41x); median SDE ~$940k, median sale price ~$2.98M. Revenue multiple average ~0.50x. Source: industry valuation/transaction summaries.
- **Comparable sales:** No comps identified for “ShoreHome” or same geography/segment. **Primary:** BizBuySell, DealStats, or broker comps for roofing/outdoor living in Sarasota/Manatee/Charlotte.
- **Exit pathways:** Strategic sale, management buyout, or wind-down are plausible; no indication of franchise or institutional buyer interest.
- **Value drivers (conceptual):** Positive: diversified service mix, local reputation (if proven), long lease (if favorable). Negative: owner dependency, customer concentration, unverified financials, license/entity risk.
- **SBA 7(a) bankability:** Cannot assess without verified P&L, tax returns, and clean legal/license. **Primary:** Review with lender if debt is part of transaction.

**Confidence:** Low (no financials).  
**Risk flag:** Red — valuation not possible without primary data.

## Section 15 — Synthesis & Risk-Weighted Assessment

### A. Section Scorecard

No GBP listing. Shore Home Remodeling (4.9, 50+ reviews) confirmed as DIFFERENT entity. | Medium | Red |
| Legal & Compliance | No litigation found; license verified (CBC1267990, active to 08/31/2026); BBB not found | Medium | Watch |

- Professional, current web presence and content marketing (blog, clear CTAs).  
- Stated focus on quality materials and warranties; alignment with resilience and climate.

### E. Strategic Verdict

1. **Healthy, at-risk, or distressed?** **Uncertain.** The business presents as an active, marketing-oriented local contractor with a plausible service set and geography, but **desk research cannot confirm corporate identity, license, ownership, financials, or reputation** for this specific entity. Until primary verification is complete, it cannot be classified as healthy, at-risk, or distressed.

2. **Single most important factor:** **Verification of corporate identity and license** (Sunbiz + DBPR + owner identification). Without this, all other conclusions are conditional.

3. **One action that would most change the risk profile:** **Obtain and review verified financials (P&L and tax returns), lease terms, and conduct 3–5 customer and 2+ local professional reference checks.** This would move the assessment from “unverifiable” to a risk-weighted conclusion and enable valuation and stress-testing.
