# Andrew Martin — Brand Personas

> These are the real people who will encounter your brand. Each persona captures who they are, what pressures they're under, what they're actually looking for (not what they say they're looking for), and how your brand can meet them without changing who you are — just by emphasizing the right facet of yourself at the right moment.

---

## How to Use This Document

Each persona has:
- **Who they are** — role, context, daily reality
- **What they're actually evaluating** — the unspoken criteria
- **What makes them say yes** — the trust trigger
- **What makes them move on** — the deal-breaker
- **Where they encounter you** — the surfaces that matter
- **How your brand meets them** — what to emphasize (from your existing truth) and how to frame it

You don't become a different person for each audience. You turn the same diamond to catch a different light.

## Persona 1: The Partner Who Needs a Win

### Who They Are

**Name archetype:** "David" — Managing Director or Partner at PwC (or another Big Four / tier-one firm)

**Reality:** David manages a portfolio of client relationships and is measured on revenue, utilization, and client satisfaction. He has 6–10 active accounts and is under pressure to bring AI into engagements because every client is asking for it and every competitor is pitching it. He has plenty of people who can write decks about AI. He has almost nobody who can *build* AI things that work in a client's actual environment.

**Daily pressure:** He needs to sell work, staff it with people who won't embarrass him, and deliver outcomes that lead to follow-on engagements. He's terrified of putting someone in front of a client who overpromises and under-delivers on AI — because the client's board is watching, and a bad AI engagement damages the relationship for years.

**Age/career stage:** Late 40s to early 60s. Made Partner 5–15 years ago. Understands strategy deeply. Does *not* understand the technical details of agent pipelines or prompt engineering. Doesn't need to — but needs someone who does AND who can translate it into language his client's CFO understands.

### What They're Actually Evaluating

| They say | They mean |
|----------|-----------|
| "We need someone with AI expertise" | "I need someone who won't make me look bad" |
| "Can you lead a workstream?" | "Can I put you in front of a client unsupervised?" |
| "We need a prototype for this pursuit" | "Can you build something real in 5 days that helps me win the deal?" |
| "Tell me about your experience" | "Give me a story I can retell in a client meeting" |

### What Makes Them Say Yes

- **A retellable proof point.** David needs to say to his client: "We have a Director who built a 10-agent pipeline that compressed 3 weeks of CRM migration analysis into hours. He did it for [similar client]." That's a sentence he can use in a pursuit. If your brand gives him that sentence in under 30 seconds, he's interested.
- **Low risk.** You've been at PwC 14+ years. You know how the firm works. You won't go rogue, burn a client relationship, or need hand-holding. That's enormous to a Partner. They don't want to manage you.
- **Range.** You can sit in a room with a CTO and talk architecture, then sit with a CFO and talk ROI. David doesn't have many people who can do both. When he finds one, he holds on.

### What Makes Them Move On

- **Vagueness.** If your brand says "AI thought leader" without a specific outcome attached, David puts you in the "marketing" bucket. He's heard it from 50 people.
- **Complexity.** If your site or profile requires more than 60 seconds to understand what you do and who you've done it for, he's gone. Partners are the busiest people in the firm. Respect that.
- **No evidence of client-facing work.** If everything on your profile is internal or theoretical, David worries you can't perform in a client setting.

### Where They Encounter You

1. **Internal referral / email forward** — Someone says "you should talk to Andrew Martin" and sends your LinkedIn or site. This is the #1 channel. David will spend 30–90 seconds scanning.
2. **LinkedIn profile** — Quick scan of headline, about section, and most recent role. He's looking for pattern-match: "AI + delivery + PwC + specific outcomes."
3. **Your site** — Only if he's seriously considering you for a pursuit or engagement. He wants to see evidence, not design.

### How Your Brand Meets David

**Emphasize:**
- Named outcomes with scale ("compressed 3 weeks → hours," "4 territories in 6 months," "10-agent pipeline")
- Client-facing work and industries served (FSI, healthcare, retail, energy)
- The fact that you *build the demo and present to leadership* — this is David's dream: one person who can do both
- Your 14+ year PwC tenure — this is trust shorthand inside the firm

**Frame it as:**
> "I'm the person you put in the room when the client asks 'can you actually build this?' and you need the answer to be yes — demonstrated live, that week."

**On your site:** Make sure the Impact section is scannable in under 10 seconds. Named outcomes. Industry tags. No paragraph needed — just the proof line and one sentence of context.

**On LinkedIn:** Your headline and first two lines of your About section need to give David a retellable sentence. Current About opening is strong: "I'm the person teams call when AI ambition collides with delivery reality." That works. Keep it.

## Persona 2: The C-Suite Buyer Who's Been Burned

### Who They Are

**Name archetype:** "Sarah" — SVP of Digital, Chief Digital Officer, or CTO at a Fortune 500 or large enterprise

**Reality:** Sarah's board told her 18 months ago to "figure out AI." She hired a consulting firm. They delivered a strategy deck, a roadmap, and a pilot that never made it to production. She spent $2M and has a PowerPoint to show for it. She is now allergic to consultants who talk and don't build. She needs someone who can get something into production that her team can actually maintain.

**Daily pressure:** She has internal teams that are skeptical of consultants, a board that wants visible AI wins, a compliance team that blocks anything without proper governance, and a budget that just got cut by 20%. She cannot afford another "exploration phase." She needs outcomes in 90 days.

**Age/career stage:** Mid 40s to mid 50s. Technically literate but not a developer. Can tell the difference between someone who understands architecture and someone faking it. Has excellent BS radar.

### What They're Actually Evaluating

| They say | They mean |
|----------|-----------|
| "We need a strategic partner" | "I need someone who can ship, not just advise" |
| "What's your approach to AI governance?" | "Will this survive my compliance team?" |
| "Can you work with our internal teams?" | "Will you make my people better, or just take over and leave?" |
| "Show me similar work" | "Prove you've done this before — in my industry, at my scale, with real constraints" |

### What Makes Them Say Yes

- **A live artifact.** If you can show her a working prototype, a real output from an agent pipeline, or a before/after of something you actually built — she leans in. She's been shown enough slides. She wants to see the thing.
- **Governance credibility.** Sarah's biggest hidden fear is that the AI project gets blocked by compliance or creates a security incident. Your "governance without bureaucracy" and "human-in-the-loop from day one" message directly addresses her #1 risk. Lean into it hard.
- **Enablement, not dependence.** She doesn't want a consultant who builds a black box and leaves. She wants someone who builds *and* teaches her team how it works. Your "enablement as force multiplier" philosophy — AI Champions, Cursor training, prompt libraries — is exactly what she's looking for. It means she won't need you forever, which paradoxically makes her want to hire you now.

### What Makes Them Move On

- **Consulting-speak.** If your site reads like a capabilities deck ("We help organizations transform their digital landscape"), Sarah closes the tab. She's been sold to enough.
- **No technical depth.** If everything is strategy-level and she can't tell whether you've actually written code or configured a pipeline, she doesn't trust you. She needs to see the engineering beneath the executive.
- **No industry relevance.** If your work is all generic "AI" without specific industry context (FSI, pharma, retail), she can't map you onto her problem.

### Where They Encounter You

1. **Referral from her network** — 63% of enterprise buyers start by asking peers. If a peer CDO says "we worked with Andrew Martin at PwC," your site/LinkedIn is the next stop.
2. **LinkedIn content** — If you post about a real problem you solved (not a hot take on AI trends), she may find you there. CTOs/CDOs follow people who share *how*, not just *what*.
3. **A pursuit / proposal** — She may encounter you as the named delivery lead in a PwC proposal. Your bio in that document is a mini-brand moment.

### How Your Brand Meets Sarah

**Emphasize:**
- Artifacts and real outputs. If you can show one screenshot, one diagram, one before/after — it does more than 500 words.
- "Governance without bureaucracy" — position this as a *feature*, not a footnote. For Sarah, it's the reason she says yes.
- Enablement: "I build it, and I teach your team how to own it." This removes her biggest concern (consultant dependency).
- Industry specifics: FSI, healthcare, retail, energy. Name the verticals so she can map herself in.

**Frame it as:**
> "Last time you hired a firm, you got a deck. I'll have a working prototype in your environment before the strategy doc is final."

**On your site:** The "How I Work" section needs to feel *operational*, not theoretical. Replace generic labels with specific language: "Day 1–3: I'm in your codebase" instead of "Rapid Assessment." Sarah wants to smell the concrete.

**On LinkedIn:** Post structured case studies. Not "Here are 5 AI trends for 2026." Instead: "We compressed 3 weeks of CRM migration analysis to 4 hours. Here's the pipeline, what each agent does, and what we kept human." That's the content Sarah shares with her team.

## Persona 3: The Executive Recruiter Running a Search

### Who They Are

**Name archetype:** "Rachel" — Senior recruiter at a retained executive search firm (Spencer Stuart, Heidrick & Struggles, Korn Ferry) or an internal talent lead at a tech company, PE-backed portfolio company, or rival consulting firm

**Reality:** Rachel has a search open for a VP of AI, Head of Digital Transformation, or similar title. The role requires someone who can do strategy *and* get technical. She has 50 LinkedIn profiles open in tabs. She needs to narrow to 5 in the next 48 hours. She's scanning, not reading. She's pattern-matching against a spec her client gave her: "15+ years, consulting or enterprise, AI/ML experience, executive presence, hands-on technical credibility."

**Daily pressure:** Her reputation depends on delivering strong candidates fast. She needs to present you in a way that makes her client excited. That means she needs *your* brand to do most of the work — she'll repackage it, but she needs the raw material.

### What They're Actually Evaluating

| They say | They mean |
|----------|-----------|
| "Tell me about yourself" | "Give me 3 bullet points I can put in my candidate brief" |
| "What's your leadership style?" | "Will my client's CEO like being in a room with you?" |
| "Why are you open to this?" | "Are you actually movable, or are you window shopping?" |
| "What's your technical depth?" | "Can I position you as technical *and* strategic without one undermining the other?" |

### What Makes Them Say Yes (to presenting you)

- **A scannable, specific profile.** Rachel needs to grab your headline, 3 proof points, and one differentiator in 30 seconds. If your LinkedIn or site gives her that, you make the shortlist. If she has to dig, you don't.
- **Dual positioning.** "Strategy + engineering in one person" is catnip for a recruiter filling a VP/AI role. Most candidates are one or the other. If your brand clearly signals *both* with evidence, Rachel can position you as a unicorn to her client.
- **Named companies and outcomes.** Rachel's client brief says things like "experience with Fortune 500" and "measurable outcomes." Your PwC tenure, your client list (FSI, retail, healthcare), and your specific metrics (90%, 4 territories, 10-agent pipeline) are exactly what she needs to fill in the brief.

### What Makes Them Move On

- **Generic everything.** If your headline says "Technology Leader | Innovator | Digital Transformation" — Rachel can't distinguish you from 200 other profiles. She needs specificity.
- **No Google presence.** 85% of recruiters check your online reputation before reaching out. If they Google "Andrew Martin AI PwC" and find nothing beyond LinkedIn, it's a yellow flag. Your personal site fixes this — it's the #2 Google result you control.
- **Modesty that reads as lack of impact.** If your profile undersells outcomes or hides them in long paragraphs, Rachel misses them. She's not reading your 5th paragraph. She's scanning your first 3 lines and your most recent role bullets.

### Where They Encounter You

1. **LinkedIn search** — This is the primary channel. Boolean search: "Director" AND "AI" AND "PwC" AND "delivery." Your headline determines whether she clicks.
2. **Google search** — Second channel: "Andrew Martin PwC AI." Your personal site and LinkedIn should own the first page.
3. **Referral** — A colleague or former coworker recommends you. Rachel then checks your profiles.

### How Your Brand Meets Rachel

**Emphasize:**
- **Headline:** Make it specific and keyword-rich. Current LinkedIn option 1 is good: "Director at PwC | AI Delivery & Digital Transformation | Turning Strategy into Shipped Products." It's scannable, searchable, and differentiating.
- **First 2 lines of About:** Must contain the retellable differentiator. "Strategy + engineering in one person" is the hook.
- **Metrics in role descriptions:** Front-load numbers. Rachel copy-pastes these into candidate briefs.
- **Your site as Google presence:** It should rank for "Andrew Martin AI" and provide a concise, professional one-page that Rachel can screenshot or link in an email to her client.

**Frame it as:**
> Rachel doesn't need to be convinced. She needs to be *armed*. Give her the ammunition to sell you to her client in a 2-minute phone call.

**On your site:** Add a short, prominent section (3–4 lines) near the top that reads like an executive summary / bio that a recruiter could copy-paste or screenshot. Think: role, years, differentiator, top 2 proof points.

**On LinkedIn:** Recommendations from Partners or senior colleagues are the single highest-trust signal for recruiters. Even 2–3 would change the game.

## Persona 4: The Alliance Partner Looking for a Champion

### Who They Are

**Name archetype:** "Marcus" — Alliance Director or GTM lead at Salesforce, Zoom, Microsoft, or a similar technology vendor with a PwC partnership

**Reality:** Marcus's company has an alliance agreement with PwC. He needs PwC people who can co-sell and co-deliver joint solutions. Most PwC people he works with are strategists who can talk about the platform but can't demo it, configure it, or explain how it integrates into a client's existing stack. He's looking for someone inside PwC who is *technical enough* to be credible with his product team and *senior enough* to influence PwC pursuit decisions.

**Daily pressure:** His quota depends on PwC-sourced pipeline. He needs PwC Directors and Partners who will champion his platform in pursuits. He's competing with Deloitte, Accenture, and others for PwC's attention. He needs a personal relationship with someone who actually uses or understands his technology, not just someone who attends the quarterly alliance meeting.

### What They're Actually Evaluating

| They say | They mean |
|----------|-----------|
| "Let's explore co-sell opportunities" | "Will you actually bring us into your next deal?" |
| "Do you work with our platform?" | "Can you demo it or build on it, or do you just know the name?" |
| "How does your team use AI?" | "Are you building things I can reference with other partners?" |
| "Let's do a joint workshop" | "I need your name and PwC's logo attached to my pipeline" |

### What Makes Them Say Yes

- **Technical credibility.** If you can talk about Agentforce, Dataverse, or Azure architecture with specifics — not just "we work with Salesforce" — Marcus knows you're someone he can bring to a joint client meeting without risk.
- **Delivery track record.** Marcus needs reference stories. "We used [platform] to build X for a [industry] client and it produced Y outcome." That's a case study for his team.
- **Influence inside PwC.** Your CSX/CT&I role means you touch pursuit decisions and investment governance. Marcus wants access to the decision-making layer, and you sit at it.

### What Makes Them Move On

- **Platform-agnostic vagueness.** If your brand just says "CRM" without naming platforms, Marcus can't tell if you're a champion for his technology or a competitor's.
- **No public signal.** If there's nothing online connecting "Andrew Martin" to "Salesforce" or "Agentforce" or "Zoom CX," Marcus won't find you when he's searching for PwC allies.

### Where They Encounter You

1. **Alliance meetings / events** — In-person or virtual. Your LinkedIn profile is the follow-up artifact.
2. **LinkedIn search** — Marcus searches PwC + Salesforce + AI (or PwC + Zoom + CX). Your profile keywords determine visibility.
3. **Internal referral** — A PwC colleague introduces you. Marcus checks your profile before the first call.

### How Your Brand Meets Marcus

**Emphasize:**
- **Name the platforms you work with.** Salesforce, Agentforce, Dynamics 365, Dataverse, Azure. Be specific. This is keyword matching for alliance people.
- **Joint value framing.** Instead of "I know Salesforce," frame it as "I built a 10-agent CRM migration pipeline that produces Salesforce-ready user stories and compliance validation." That's a co-sell story Marcus can use.
- **Your GTM experience.** Your Workplace from Facebook GTM role is directly relevant — you've been on the *vendor* side. You understand what Marcus needs. Signal that.

**Frame it as:**
> "I'm the PwC person who can demo your platform in a client meeting, not just reference it in a deck."

---

## Persona 5: The Internal Sponsor Evaluating You for More

### Who They Are

**Name archetype:** "Vikas" or "Ian" — A Partner or Managing Director inside PwC who has worked with you, sees your work regularly, and is evaluating whether to expand your scope, champion you for promotion, or put you on a high-stakes engagement

**Reality:** This person already knows you. They see your weekly status updates, your POCs, your investment governance work. What they're evaluating is whether you're *ready for the next level* — not whether you're competent (they know you are), but whether you can represent yourself at the level above.

**Daily pressure:** They need to justify your promotion or expanded role to their peers in a committee. They need *evidence* and *narrative* — a clear, defensible story about why you deserve more scope.

### What They're Actually Evaluating

| They say | They mean |
|----------|-----------|
| "What's your impact this year?" | "Give me the story I'll tell the promotion committee" |
| "Can you handle the client relationship?" | "Will you make me proud or make me nervous?" |
| "How are you developing the team?" | "Are you just a doer, or are you building capacity around yourself?" |
| "What's your point of view on [topic]?" | "Do you have executive presence? Can you hold a room?" |

### What Makes Them Say Yes

- **A ready-made narrative.** If your brand materials (LinkedIn, site, internal profile) already tell a clear, evidenced story — it makes the sponsor's job easy. They can borrow your language for the committee.
- **Evidence of team enablement.** AI Champions, prompt libraries, Cursor training sessions — these show you're not a solo performer, you're a multiplier. That's the Partner-track signal.
- **External visibility (tasteful).** A well-made personal site and active, substantive LinkedIn presence signals executive presence and personal brand maturity. It shows you operate at a level above your current title.

### What Makes Them Hesitate

- **No public narrative.** If you can't articulate your own story, a sponsor worries you can't articulate PwC's story to a client.
- **All execution, no voice.** If you only show up as the person who *does* things but never shapes the conversation, you stay a Director. Partners need thought leadership and point of view — not fluff, but structured opinions backed by evidence.
- **Underselling.** If you describe your work in humble, vague terms, your sponsor has to do the translation work for the committee. Don't make them do that.

### Where They Encounter Your Brand

1. **Your weekly status updates and investment governance docs** — These *are* brand moments. The quality of your written updates signals readiness.
2. **LinkedIn** — If they search you (or a committee member does), does your profile tell the right story?
3. **Your personal site** — For an internal sponsor, this is a signal of ambition, polish, and executive brand awareness. It shows you think beyond your current role.

### How Your Brand Meets Vikas/Ian

**Emphasize:**
- **Structured narrative of impact.** Your status updates already do this ("what shipped, what's in motion, what support is needed"). Make sure your external brand mirrors that same clarity.
- **Enablement and team development.** AI Champions, training sessions, reusable IP. Frame yourself as someone who builds capability, not just output.
- **Point of view.** Have an opinion on AI governance, on delivery methodology, on how consulting should work in the age of AI. The whitepaper material you've written is exactly this — make it visible.

**Frame it as:**
> "I don't just execute — I shape how the team thinks about AI delivery. Here's the framework I built, here's who's using it, here's what it produced."

---

## Persona 6: The Technical Peer Deciding Whether to Work With You

### Who They Are

**Name archetype:** "Priya" — A senior architect, delivery lead, or technical manager at PwC or at a client organization who's been told they'll be working with you

**Reality:** Priya has been on projects with senior consultants who couldn't code, couldn't debug, and couldn't review a pull request — but who made decisions about the architecture anyway. She's wary. She's checking whether you're a "real" technologist or a title-holder who delegates everything and takes credit.

**Age/career stage:** Mid 30s to mid 40s. Deep technical expertise. Doesn't care about your title. Cares about whether you'll slow her down or make her faster.

### What They're Actually Evaluating

| They say | They mean |
|----------|-----------|
| "What's your technical background?" | "Have you actually written code in the last 12 months?" |
| "How do you like to work with the team?" | "Will you micromanage or enable?" |
| "What tools do you use?" | "Are you in Cursor/VS Code, or are you in PowerPoint?" |
| "What's your approach to architecture decisions?" | "Will you override me with a bad take because you outrank me?" |

### What Makes Them Say Yes

- **Technical signal in your brand.** The monospace font, the console easter egg, the JetBrains Mono — these are small signals Priya picks up on. But they need to be backed by substance: mention of actual tools, actual codebases assessed, actual pipelines built.
- **Enablement language.** "I built prompt libraries that teams use daily" and "I run Cursor/AI tooling enablement sessions" — this tells Priya you'll make her better, not slow her down.
- **Humility in the technical details.** If you frame it as "I build prototypes to unblock decisions, and then hand off to the team for production hardening" — that's honest and respected. It says you know your role.

### What Makes Them Move On

- **All strategy, no tools.** If your profile reads like a management consultant with no evidence of technical work, Priya checks out.
- **Overclaiming.** If you claim to be a "full-stack engineer" when you're a Director who prototypes — Priya will find out in the first sprint and lose trust.

### Where They Encounter You

1. **Project kickoff / staffing email** — They Google you before the first meeting.
2. **LinkedIn** — Quick scan for technical credibility signals.
3. **Your site** — If it exists, they'll look. The code quality of the site itself is a signal (Priya will view source).

### How Your Brand Meets Priya

**Emphasize:**
- **Specific tools.** Cursor, Docker, React, Python, GitHub Actions. Name them.
- **What you build vs. what you lead.** Be precise: "I prototype, I assess codebases, I build prompt libraries. I don't pretend to be a senior engineer — I'm a Director who builds to unblock."
- **Enablement over authority.** Frame your role as "making the team faster," not "leading the team."

**Frame it as:**
> "I'll have a working POC before the first sprint planning. Then it's yours — I'll support, not hover."

---

## Summary: One Brand, Six Facets

| Persona | What they need from you in 10 words | What to emphasize |
|---------|------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **The Partner** | A retellable proof point and zero risk | Named outcomes, PwC tenure, dual capability |
| **The C-Suite Buyer** | A live artifact and governance credibility | Prototypes, "governance without bureaucracy," enablement |
| **The Recruiter** | Scannable specificity and dual positioning | Headline, metrics, strategy + engineering hook |
| **The Alliance Partner** | Technical depth on their platform + PwC access | Named platforms, co-sell stories, GTM experience |
| **The Internal Sponsor** | A ready-made narrative for the committee | Impact story, enablement, point of view |
| **The Technical Peer** | Proof you build real things and won't slow them down | Tools, honest scoping, enablement posture |

---

## The Principle: Meet Them, Don't Become Them

You don't need six versions of yourself. You need **one clear brand** with enough structured detail that each persona can find their answer quickly.

- The Partner finds the retellable proof point in your Impact section.
- The C-Suite buyer finds the governance and prototype language in your Process section.
- The Recruiter finds the scannable headline and top-line metrics in your hero and LinkedIn.
- The Alliance Partner finds the named platforms in your Expertise section.
- The Internal Sponsor finds the enablement narrative and point of view in your Superpower and Journey.
- The Technical Peer finds the real tools and honest framing in your About and Expertise.

**Same content. Same voice. Same you.** Just organized so each person can find what *they* need without wading through what they don't.

That's not changing who you are. That's architecture. And you're good at architecture.
