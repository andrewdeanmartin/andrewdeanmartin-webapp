# Portfolio narrative: one connected theme

**North star:** *Turn AI ambition into what actually ships* — making ideas real, governed, and scalable.

The page is a single story: **who** → **how** → **see it** → **proof** → **next**. Each section is different but connected; every section drives toward that north star.

## The flow (this, then that, then the next)

| Section | Role | Handoff to next |
|--------|------|------------------|
| **Hero** | Who + promise: ideas become real, fast. | (CTA: See It In Action / Connect) |
| **About** | Why I'm the one: delivery reality, roadmaps → outcomes. | "The demos below show how." |
| **How I Work** | Methods: strategy+engineering, prototypes, AI as method, governance, range. | *(Bridge)* Those approaches show up in the tools below. |
| **Demos** | See it in practice: four tools that put the approach into action. | *(Bridge)* This way of working has produced measurable results. |
| **Impact** | Proof: weeks→hours, 90% cycle cut, 15+ prototypes shipped. | *(Bridge)* If that sounds like the partnership you need— |
| **Connect** | Next: let's compare notes and turn your ambition into what ships. | — |

## Bridge copy (in the live site)

- **Before Demos intro:** *"Those approaches show up in the four tools below. "* → then the existing "Here's what 'what actually ships' looks like in practice..."
- **Before Impact content:** *"This way of working has produced measurable results."* → then the existing impact intro.
- **Before Connect body:** *"If that sounds like the partnership you need, let's talk."* → then the existing "Working on AI delivery..."

## Echoes of the north star

The phrase *"what actually ships"* (or the idea) appears in:

- **Hero:** tagline "What Actually Ships"
- **About:** "making them real, governed, and scalable"
- **Demos:** "what 'what actually ships' looks like in practice"
- **Impact:** "ship demos that move decisions," "Real artifact, not just a deck"
- **Connect / Footer:** "turn your ambition into something that ships" (optional echo)

Keeping these echoes consistent reinforces one theme.
