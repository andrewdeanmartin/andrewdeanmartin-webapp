### Ownership Confirmation Path

John Dale Ross is confirmed at this address via two independent FL state databases:

1. **FL DBPR — Mold Remediator License MRSR2877:** Main address listed as "320 29TH STREET NORTHWEST, BRADENTON, Florida 34205" (Manatee County). Status: Delinquent/Active, expired 07/31/2024.
2. **FL DBPR — Certified Building Contractor CBC1267990:** Main address 320 29th Street NW, Bradenton, FL 34205. Status: Current, Active (expires 08/31/2026). DBA: SHOREHOME LLC.
3. **FL Sunbiz — SHOREHOME LLC (L24000391788):** Principal and mailing address both 320 29TH STREET NW, BRADENTON, FL 34205. John Ross listed as MGR (manager) at same address.

**Primary action required:** Pull actual Manatee County PAO parcel record (in-person, by phone at 941-748-8208, or via ArcGIS map) to confirm: (a) legal owner on deed, (b) assessed and just/market value, (c) homestead exemption (would confirm owner-occupied residence), (d) property use code, (e) any liens or encumbrances.

## 2. Zoning Designation

| Element | Finding | Confidence |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Likely zoning** | **R-1 (Low Density Single Family) or R-2 (Moderate Density Residential)** | Estimated — based on neighborhood character |
| **Zoned for commercial/contractor use?** | **No — not as a primary use** | High (residential neighborhood) |
| **Home occupation permit possible?** | Yes — Manatee County and City of Bradenton allow home occupations in residential zones with permit | Verified (general policy) |
| **Form-based code area?** | Unlikely — form-based codes (T4, T5, T6) apply to downtown/arterial corridors; this is interior residential | Estimated |

### Zoning District Details (City of Bradenton)

**R-1 (if applicable):**
- Min lot area: 7,200 sqft
- Max density: 6 units/acre
- Min street frontage: 50 ft
- Setbacks: 20 ft front, 8 ft side, 20 ft rear
- Permitted uses: Single-family dwellings, home occupations (with permit)

**R-2 (if applicable):**
- Min lot area: 6,500 sqft (single unit) or 8,500 sqft (two units)
- Max density: 10 units/acre
- Permits single-family and two-family dwellings

**Diligence implication:** If SHOREHOME LLC operates from this address, it is likely operating under a home occupation or simply using the owner's residence as a mailing/registered address. A roofing/outdoor living contractor storing equipment, materials, or running crews from a residential address may face code enforcement risk depending on activity level. The UCC-financed Kubota SVL75-3 track loader stored at a residential property would raise visibility.

**Source:** City of Bradenton Planning & Zoning (cityofbradenton.com); Manatee County Land Development Code; ArcGIS zoning layer (Zoning_CoB)

**Primary action required:** Verify exact zoning via City of Bradenton interactive zoning map or by calling Planning & Zoning at 941-932-9414. Ask specifically about home occupation permit status for this address.

## 3. Physical Description & Neighborhood Character

| Element | Finding | Confidence |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Property type** | **Single-family residential home** (probable) | High |
| **Likely description** | 2–3 bed, 1–2 bath, ~1,000–1,400 sqft, on ~0.16–0.24 acre lot, built 1950s–1970s | Estimated (from comps) |
| **Neighborhood** | Quiet, tree-lined, established single-family residential | Verified (multiple listings describe) |
| **Sub-area** | West Bradenton, near Riverview Blvd / "River District" | Verified |
| **Proximity** | Minutes from downtown Bradenton; ~6 miles from Bradenton Beach | Verified |
| **Street infrastructure** | Asphalt roads, city services | Verified |
| **Is it an office, warehouse, or yard?** | **No — it is almost certainly a residential home used as a business mailing address** | High |

### Assessment

The 29th Street NW corridor in 34205 is a **modest, established residential neighborhood** of single-family homes on small lots. Properties are mid-century construction (1950s–1970s), typically 2 bedrooms/1 bath to 3 bedrooms/2 bath. There is no visible commercial, industrial, or mixed-use character on this block based on listings and neighborhood descriptions.

**This is not a commercial office, warehouse, showroom, or contractor yard.** The most likely scenario is:
- John Dale Ross **lives here** (owner-occupied residence)
- SHOREHOME LLC uses the address as its **registered/mailing address** and possibly home office
- Actual job staging, equipment storage, and crew dispatch may happen here or at a separate unlisted location

**Primary action required:** Site visit (drive-by or in-person) to observe: exterior condition, signage, vehicles/trailers, equipment storage, any commercial activity visible. Google Street View would also provide visual confirmation.

## 4. Nearby Development & Infrastructure

| Project | Description | Status | Distance/Relevance |
|---------|-------------|--------|--------------------|
| **14th Street CRA** (Tamiami Trail) | Community Redevelopment Area; streetscaping ($5.6M), beautification, mixed-use redevelopment | Active | ~0.5–1 mile east of property |
| **Forest Cove Affordable Housing** | 156-unit development near Cortez Rd W & 14th St W; $5.66M county loan approved | Construction summer 2025 | ~1 mile south |
| **SeaFlower Master-Planned Community** | 1,175-acre development (4,000+ homes, hotels, commercial) on former flower farm near Palma Sola | Broke ground 2025 | ~3–4 miles west |
| **Grand Palms Senior Housing** | 72-unit 55+ facility at 1715 14th St W | Completed | ~1 mile east |
| **Housing Rehabilitation Program** | $1.2M program, 0% interest loans for low-income homeowners | Opened March 2025 | County-wide |
| **Village of the Arts** | Urban design study and arts district revitalization (14th St CRA area) | Ongoing | ~1 mile east |

### Implications for Property

- The 14th Street CRA corridor is the nearest active redevelopment zone; property at 320 29th St NW is ~0.5–1 mile west of this corridor and **not within the CRA boundary** (estimated)
- SeaFlower will add significant housing stock to west Bradenton over the next decade, which could increase demand for roofing/outdoor living services
- No indication the 29th St NW block itself is targeted for rezoning, demolition, or redevelopment
- Overall trend: **west Bradenton is growing** but this specific block appears stable/residential

## 5. Commercial Rent Context — Bradenton 34205

| Space Type | Rate ($/SF/YR) | Example | Source |
|------------|-----------------|---------|--------|
| **New flex/industrial** | **$23.00** | 2701 14th St W — 1,560 SF units, 3-yr terms | LoopNet |
| **Established warehouse** | **$11.00–$11.50** | 1734 5th St W — 5,500 SF freestanding, NNN | LoopNet, CommercialCafe |
| **Office/commercial** | **$15–$20** (estimated) | General Bradenton metro | Estimated |

### Context for ShoreHome

If SHOREHOME LLC were to lease a dedicated commercial/flex/warehouse space in 34205:
- A 1,500–2,000 sqft flex space would cost roughly **$2,875–$3,833/mo** at $23/SF/YR
- A 3,000–5,000 sqft warehouse would cost roughly **$2,750–$4,792/mo** at $11–$11.50/SF/YR
- Currently, if operating from the owner's residence, the **effective occupancy cost is $0** (or imputed below-market)

**Diligence implication:** Operating from a home address eliminates rent expense, which flatters margins. However, it also limits growth capacity, professional image, and crew/equipment staging. A transition to commercial space would add $33,000–$58,000/yr in occupancy cost. This should be factored into any financial model or valuation.

## 6. UCC Address Check: 320 26th St W, Bradenton, FL 34205

| Element | Finding | Confidence |
|---------|---------|------------|
| **Does 320 26th St W exist?** | **Uncertain — no standalone property found at this exact address** | Medium |
| **Most likely explanation** | **Data entry error on UCC filing** — transposition of "26th" vs "29th" and "W" vs "NW" | High |
| **Alternative match** | 2901 26th St W, **Unit 320** — a condo unit in an 8-story building | Possible but unlikely |
| **Is it a different property?** | **Probably not — probably the same property (320 29th St NW) with a filing error** | High |

### Analysis

The UCC1 filing (202503811777, filed 10/04/2025) lists the debtor address as **"320 26th St W, Bradenton, FL 34205"** for both SHORE HOME LLC and ROSS, JOHN DALE. However:

1. **Every other official filing** uses **320 29th St NW**: Sunbiz (principal, mailing, registered agent), FL DBPR Contractor license, FL DBPR Mold Remediator license
2. **No property record** was found for "320 26th St W" as a standalone address
3. The closest real address is **2901 26th St W, Unit 320** — a 2-bed, 2-bath condo (~940 sqft, HOA $550/mo, units selling $140–165K) in an all-age community. This does not match a contractor's operating address
4. **319 26th St W** exists (5 bed, 4.5 bath, 3,912 sqft, 1925 historic home, listed $1.325M) — but "320 26th St W" does not appear in any listing or record

### Nearby properties on 26th St W for reference

| Address | Type | Details | Price |
|---------|------|---------|-------|
| 301 26th St W | SFH | 3/2, 1,904 sqft, 0.287 ac, pool, built 1950/updated 1984 | Sold $600K (Sep 2023) |
| 319 26th St W | SFH | 5/4.5, 3,912 sqft, 0.48 ac, restored 1925, Airbnb | Listed $1.325M |
| 2901 26th St W, Unit 320 | Condo | 2/2, ~940 sqft, 8-story bldg | ~$160K (2025) |

**Conclusion:** The UCC address "320 26th St W" is almost certainly a **clerical/data-entry error** for **320 29th St NW**. The "26th" vs "29th" and "W" vs "NW" differences are consistent with a typo or address auto-fill error during electronic UCC filing. There is **no evidence of a second operating location.**

**Primary action required:** Confirm with SHOREHOME LLC principals that 320 29th St NW is the sole business address and that the UCC address is a filing error. Consider whether a UCC amendment is needed to correct the address.

## 7. Key Takeaways & Risk Flags

### Summary Table

| Question | Answer | Status |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Who owns the property? | John Dale Ross (probable; confirmed at address via multiple state filings) | **Needs PAO confirmation** |
| What type of property? | Residential single-family home | **Verified** (neighborhood evidence) |
| Assessed/market value? | Estimated $250K–$350K (based on comps) | **Estimated** |
| Any recent sales? | Not found | **Unverified** |
| Zoning designation? | Likely R-1 or R-2 (residential) | **Estimated** |
| Zoned for contractor use? | No — not as primary commercial use; home occupation possible with permit | **Verified** (general policy) |
| What does it look like? | Modest single-family home, 2–3 bed, ~1,000–1,400 sqft, 1950s–1970s build | **Estimated** (from comps) |
| Nearby development? | 14th St CRA, SeaFlower, Forest Cove; area is growing | **Verified** |
| Commercial rent in area? | $11–$23/SF/YR (warehouse to flex) | **Verified** |
| UCC address different? | Almost certainly a filing error; no second location evidence | **High confidence** |

### Risk Flags

| # | Flag | Severity | Action |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **Business operating from owner's home** — no dedicated commercial space, showroom, or yard | Watch | Confirm via site visit; assess impact on growth capacity, insurance, and zoning compliance |
| 2 | **Zoning compliance risk** — storing a Kubota SVL75-3 track loader and running contractor operations from a residential zone may violate zoning or trigger code enforcement | Watch | Verify home occupation permit status; assess equipment storage arrangements |
| 3 | **No lease = no occupancy cost but no tenure protection** — if Ross moves or sells the home, the business has no fixed location | Watch | Understand whether Ross owns the home (homestead exemption?) and plans for commercial space |
| 4 | **UCC address mismatch** — "320 26th St W" vs "320 29th St NW" creates lien perfection ambiguity for Kubota Credit Corp | Low | Confirm correct address; note this is the lender's issue, not the buyer's, unless it signals sloppy filing practices |
| 5 | **Property value is modest** — ~$250K–$350K residential home is not a significant asset or collateral base | Info | Factor into valuation; the business has minimal real property backing |
