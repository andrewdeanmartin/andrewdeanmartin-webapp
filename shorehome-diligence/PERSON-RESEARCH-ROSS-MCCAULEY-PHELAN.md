### Possible Court Record (Unverified Match)

A **John Ross** (with Rachel Ross) filed a **construction defect lawsuit** against Cox Pools of the Gulf Coast, LLC in **Hillsborough County** (13th Judicial Circuit) on 05/17/2022. Case status: Pending (as of 05/21/2024). This is a *plaintiff* action, not defendant. **Caveat:** "John Ross" is a common name; this may or may not be the same John Dale Ross. The Hillsborough County filing (not Manatee) and lack of middle name make positive identification uncertain.

### Disciplinary Actions

No disciplinary actions found against John Dale Ross in DBPR web search results. However:
- The **mold remediator license (MRSR2877) is delinquent** — expired 07/31/2024 and not renewed. This is not a disciplinary action but indicates lapsed compliance.
- The DBPR "View License Complaint" page for this license should be checked directly for any filed complaints.
- No complaints or discipline found on the CBC1267990 building contractor license per prior verification.

### Other Business Entities

No other Florida business entities (LLCs, corporations, partnerships) were found linked to John Dale Ross as an officer, director, or registered agent via Sunbiz search.

### Assessment

John Dale Ross appears to be a **Florida-licensed building contractor and mold remediator** based in Bradenton. His mold license has lapsed (delinquent), but his building contractor license (CBC1267990) is reportedly current. He has **minimal public footprint** — no LinkedIn, no press coverage, no other business entities. This is not inherently negative (many tradespeople operate without social media presence), but it limits background verification. **Key-person risk is significant** — the contractor license depends on Ross as the qualifying individual; if he departs or becomes incapacitated, SHOREHOME LLC loses its license authority.

### Court Records

No court records found for "Dustyn McCauley" in Manatee County or Sarasota County via web search. Direct searches at records.manateeclerk.com and sarasotaclerk.com are recommended for completeness.

### Disciplinary Actions

Not applicable — Dustyn McCauley does not hold a personal DBPR contractor license. He is not the qualifying individual on any license found.

### Assessment

Dustyn McCauley appears to be the **business/operational side** of SHOREHOME LLC — serving as registered agent and manager but not holding a personal contractor license. His background is in **exterior construction and outdoor living** (pavers, screen enclosures) via Gulfcoast Exterior Solutions, which has legitimate commercial projects and a Chamber membership. He has a pattern of forming Florida entities in the construction/exterior space:
- GES (2021, pavers — active, healthy)
- CPW Holdings (2021, dissolved 2022 — short-lived, no public activity)
- SHOREHOME LLC (2024, roofing/outdoor — active)
- Modern Peak Roofing (2025 — newly formed)

The **CPW Holdings dissolution** within ~10 months is a minor yellow flag — could indicate a failed venture, restructuring, or simply a holding company no longer needed. No negative inference can be drawn without more context.

The formation of **Modern Peak Roofing LLC** in 2025 alongside SHOREHOME LLC raises a question about whether McCauley is building a portfolio of trade-specific entities or spinning off operations. This is not inherently concerning but warrants inquiry.

### Assessment

Michael J. Phelan Jr. operates Shore Home Remodeling LLC as a **Sarasota-area remodeling company** (not roofing). He is the sole manager and registered agent. The business is positioned as a **locally-owned, husband-and-wife operation** with a strong review profile. Notably, **no DBPR contractor license was found under Michael Phelan's name** — this could mean: (a) he operates under another individual's license (common in FL — a qualifying agent model), (b) the license is under a different name variant, or (c) certain remodeling activities don't require a GC/CBC license in Florida. This is a **gap worth flagging** if the relationship between Shore Home Remodeling and SHOREHOME LLC matters to the deal.

## 4. Relationship Analysis: SHOREHOME LLC vs. Shore Home Remodeling LLC

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| Dimension | SHOREHOME LLC | Shore Home Remodeling LLC |
|-----------|---------------|--------------------------|
| **Sunbiz Doc #** | L24000391788 | L22000440638 |
| **EIN** | 39-4344375 | 88-4187891 |
| **Filed** | 09/09/2024 | 10/12/2022 |
| **Principal Address** | 320 29th St NW, Bradenton, FL 34205 | 428 N Rossetti Dr, Nokomis, FL 34275 |
| **County** | Manatee | Sarasota |
| **Registered Agent** | Dustyn McCauley | Michael J. Phelan, Jr. |
| **Managers** | John Ross, Dustyn McCauley | Michael J. Phelan, Jr. |
| **Contractor License** | CBC1267990 (John Dale Ross) | None found |
| **Website** | shorehome.co | shorehomeremodeling.com |
| **Phone** | (941) 725-4344 | (941) 961-3362 |
| **Services** | Roofing, outdoor living, pavers, screen enclosures | Kitchen/bath remodeling, home additions, flooring, storm restoration |
| **Brand** | "ShoreHome Roofing & Outdoor Living" | "Shore Home Remodeling" |

### Connection Assessment

**Verified finding: These are two completely separate and unrelated entities.**

- **Different owners/managers** — no overlap in principals (Ross/McCauley vs. Phelan)
- **Different EINs** — confirming separate tax identities
- **Different addresses** — Bradenton (Manatee) vs. Nokomis (Sarasota)
- **Different service lines** — roofing/outdoor living vs. interior remodeling
- **Different phone numbers and websites**
- **No shared officers, agents, or addresses** across any Sunbiz filing
- **No web search results** linking Phelan to McCauley or Ross in any context

The **name similarity** ("Shore Home" / "ShoreHome") appears coincidental — both are operating in the greater Sarasota/Manatee market and likely chose the name independently based on the coastal geography. The name change of SHOREHOME LLC on 09/22/2025 (from "SHORE HOME LLC") may have been intended to create more brand distinction, or it may simply reflect a branding preference. Shore Home Remodeling LLC also had a name change event on 04/14/2025 — the nature of that change would need to be confirmed via the filing document.

**Confidence Level:** High — no corporate, personal, or financial relationship identified.

### SHOREHOME #67 LLC — Excluded

SHOREHOME #67 LLC (L23000161361) is an unrelated entity managed by James and Karen M Baker in Orlando/New Smyrna Beach. No connection to either SHOREHOME LLC or Shore Home Remodeling LLC.
