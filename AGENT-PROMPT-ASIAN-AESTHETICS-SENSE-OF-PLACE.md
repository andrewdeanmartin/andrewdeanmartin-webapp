# UX style guide: Asian-inspired aesthetics & sense of place

**Use this when:** Designing or reviewing a webpage so it feels *right*—balanced, calm, intentional—not generic or noisy. These are best-practice principles informed by East Asian design traditions (Feng Shui, Ma, wabi-sabi, yūgen, Zen aesthetics); the author is not Asian and adopts them as a style guide, not a cultural claim.

Apply Asian-inspired aesthetic and "sense of place" principles so the page feels right—balanced, calm, and intentional—not generic or noisy.

**Space & rhythm (Ma)**
- Treat negative space as active: generous margins, clear gaps between sections, breathing room around key elements.
- Create a clear visual hierarchy so the eye moves naturally; use spacing to separate ideas, not only borders or boxes.
- Allow "rest zones"—areas of quiet so the layout never feels exhausting.

**Flow & balance (Feng Shui, Yin–Yang)**
- Ensure clear information flow: no dead ends, logical next steps, primary actions in a "commanding position" (visible without hunting).
- Balance aesthetics and function: the page should be beautiful and usable; neither sterile nor chaotic.
- Prefer vertical rhythm that suggests progression (e.g. scroll path) where appropriate.
- Optional: balance 2–3 elemental qualities in palette and shape (e.g. Water + Metal = blues/grays, calm clarity; Wood = growth, green; Earth = grounding, warm neutrals).

**Restraint & subtlety (Kanso, Shibui, Yūgen)**
- Simplify: remove non-essential elements so the essential has power; avoid clutter and decoration for its own sake.
- Prefer understated beauty: muted palettes, elegant typography (considered scale, line-height, and letter-spacing—typography carries rhythm and calm), suggestion over shouting.
- Evoke mood through atmosphere (light, spacing, pacing), not through excess detail or loud CTAs unless the brand demands it.

**Naturalness & calm (Shizen, Seijaku, wabi-sabi)**
- Design for naturalness: layouts that feel unforced, with optional subtle asymmetry (Fukinsei) rather than rigid grids where it helps.
- Aim for tranquility: reduce visual and cognitive noise; the page should feel like a place users want to be, not escape from.
- Avoid sterile perfection; allow a human, authentic feel where it supports the brand.

**Sense of place**
- The page should feel like a distinct *place*: coherent symbolism, clear purpose, and an identity that matches the brand.
- Consider emotion: what should the user feel (calm, trusted, inspired)? Align spacing, color, and rhythm to that.

**Typography & rhythm**
- Use type as a carrier of rhythm and calm: consistent scale, comfortable line-height, and intentional letter-spacing so blocks of text feel like breath, not walls.

**Accessibility**
- "Calm" and "muted" must not compromise legibility. Meet contrast requirements (WCAG); ensure focus states and interactive elements remain clear.

**Asymmetry (Fukinsei) in practice**
- Use off-center focal points, uneven but balanced columns, or one strong visual weight countered by space so the layout feels alive, not templated.

**Check:** Does the result feel "right"—balanced, clear, and grounded—rather than busy, generic, or overwhelming?
