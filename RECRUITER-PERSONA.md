## A Typical Day

**6:30–7:30** — Scan LinkedIn, industry newsletters, and client job boards for new roles and talent movement.

**8:00–9:30** — Client calls: intake for new searches (VP AI Delivery at a regional bank), check-in on active searches (Director Digital at a healthcare company — stuck on "strategy vs. execution" debate).

**9:30–11:00** — Sourcing. Searches LinkedIn, internal CRM, referral networks. Keywords: "AI delivery," "multi-agent," "governance," "commercial technology," "PwC," "digital transformation director." Opens 15–20 profiles. Spends 10–15 seconds on each before deciding: pass, save, or reach out.

**11:00–12:00** — Outreach. Sends 8–12 InMails or connection requests. Personalized for the 3–4 strongest fits. For someone like Andrew: "Saw your portfolio — the agent pipeline demo is exactly what we're looking for. Quick intro call this week?"

**12:00–1:00** — Lunch (often at desk). Reads candidate materials. If a candidate has a personal site, opens it. **12-second scan:** Who is this? What do they solve? Would they fit the role?

**1:00–3:00** — Screen calls. 2–3 per day. 30 min each. Runs through: current role, why looking, salary expectations, deal-breakers (relocation, travel, etc.). For strong fits: "Can you send me a link to your portfolio or any work samples?"

**3:00–5:00** — Debriefs, write-ups for hiring managers. Prepares shortlists. Follow-up emails. Updates ATS.

## How Morgan Finds Candidates

1. **LinkedIn** — Primary. Boolean searches, saved searches, InMail. Often finds Andrew via: "Director PwC AI" or "Commercial Technology Innovation."
2. **Referrals** — 30% of placements come from referrals. Asks placed candidates and hiring managers: "Who else should I know?"
3. **Portfolio/Personal Sites** — When a candidate mentions a site or Morgan finds one via Google. Used to validate narrative, see methodology, differentiate from "resume only" candidates.
4. **Industry Events** — Speaks at 2–3 tech leadership conferences/year. Builds network.
5. **Previous Placements** — Stays in touch. "Who's ready for the next move?"

**Entry point for Andrew:** Morgan gets his name from a LinkedIn search, a referral ("You should talk to Andrew — he built our AI assessment framework"), or sees his site linked in his profile. Clicks through. **First 12 seconds matter.**

## What Morgan Evaluates (In Order)

| Priority | What Morgan Looks For | Red Flags |
|----------|------------------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Role fit** — Does their experience match the spec? PwC, consulting, delivery, AI? | Vague title, no clear domain, "jack of all trades" with no depth |
| 2 | **Proof** — Can they show work? Demos, case studies, quantifiable impact? | Resume claims with no evidence; "I led" with no numbers |
| 3 | **Differentiation** — What makes them different from the 12 other directors in the pipeline? | Generic positioning; could be anyone |
| 4 | **Communicability** — Will they interview well? Clear, concise, executive presence? | Jargon-heavy; can't explain simply |
| 5 | **Logistics** — Comp expectations, location, notice period, visa? | Unrealistic comp; 6-month notice |

**Portfolio/site role:** Validates proof (#2) and differentiation (#3). A strong site answers: "Can they actually do this?" and "Why them?"

## Morgan's Mental Models

**"Strategy vs. Execution"** — Hiring managers often want both but describe the role as one or the other. Morgan looks for candidates who can articulate both. Andrew's "strategy and code, same person" = exactly what several clients say they need but rarely find.

**"Big 4 Exit"** — Candidates leaving PwC/Deloitte/EY: Can they sell without the brand? Morgan probes: "When you won that work, were they buying you or the PwC name?" Strong candidates have evidence of personal client relationships and individual methodology.

**"Governance Tax"** — In regulated industries (finance, pharma, healthcare), AI roles require someone who gets compliance. "Cool demo" isn't enough. Morgan looks for: audit trails, human-in-the-loop, regulatory language.

**"POC Graveyard"** — Many AI initiatives die as experiments. Morgan looks for candidates who've shipped to production, scaled, or built repeatable playbooks — not just run pilots.

---

## What Morgan Cares About (Emotionally)

- **Efficiency** — Doesn't have time for unclear candidates or messy materials. Wants to know in 10 seconds if someone is worth a call.
- **Trust** — Hiring managers trust Morgan's judgment. A bad placement costs the relationship. Morgan is risk-averse on "might work" candidates.
- **Credibility** — The best candidates make Morgan look good. A director with a polished site and working demos = "I found you someone serious."
- **Reciprocity** — Good candidates refer other good candidates. Morgan nurtures long-term relationships. A "not right now" today might be a placement in 18 months.

## Morgan's Objections / Hesitations

| Objection | How Andrew's Profile Addresses It |
|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| "Is this just another consultant who can't build?" | Working demos (pipeline, SharpPrompt, assessment) — built by him, in the browser |
| "Will they get lost in the weeds?" | "Strategy and code, same person" — operates at both levels |
| "Do they understand governance?" | Audit trail, human checkpoint in pipeline; "Governance Without Bureaucracy" card |
| "Can they sell without the PwC brand?" | 15+ years, 4 territories in 6 months, first B2B2B model — evidence of individual impact |
| "Are they just looking for a paycheck?" | Site frames problem-solving for business people; intrinsic motivation implied |

---

## How Morgan Uses a Personal Site

1. **Quick validation** — Resume says "AI delivery." Site shows agent pipeline. Confirms.
2. **Differentiation** — 5 directors in pipeline. One has a site with demos. That one gets the first call.
3. **Interview prep** — Before submitting to client: "Their site has this methodology — we can speak to it in the brief."
4. **Sharing** — Sends link to hiring manager: "Take a look at their portfolio before the call. The demos are worth 5 minutes."
5. **Red flags** — Typos, broken links, outdated content = "Do they pay attention to detail?"

---

## Morgan's Tech Stack

- **ATS:** Greenhouse or Lever (client-dependent)
- **CRM:** Salesforce or custom candidate database
- **LinkedIn:** Recruiter Lite or full Recruiter
- **Research:** Google, company career pages, ZoomInfo (for comp benchmarking)
- **Communication:** Email, phone, LinkedIn InMail. Rarely texts for first outreach.

**Device:** Laptop primary. Checks LinkedIn and candidate sites on iPhone when commuting. **Site must work on mobile.**

*See It In Action — demos. Let me check.*
