# The Plan: Andrew Martin Brand Visibility Overhaul

> Three phases. LinkedIn first, website second, content engine third. Each phase has specific deliverables, rationale tied to the personas, and clear "done" criteria. Nothing here is theoretical — it's all buildable, most of it this month.

---

## Phase 1: LinkedIn Overhaul (Week 1)

**Goal:** Take your LinkedIn from 1.8/5 to 4/5 for every persona. This is the highest-leverage move because it's where all six personas look first.

---

### 1.1 — Profile Foundation (Day 1–2)

These are the changes you make in LinkedIn's editor. Most take 5–15 minutes each.

#### Headline
**Publish this:**
```
Director at PwC | AI Delivery & Digital Transformation | Turning Strategy into Shipped Products
```
**Why:** Hits Rachel's Boolean search (Director + PwC + AI + Delivery). Gives David the retellable one-liner. Signals "builder" to Priya. The "Turning Strategy into Shipped Products" half is your differentiator — it's the thing no other Director's headline says.

#### About Section
**Publish the drafted About from LINKEDIN-PROFILE.md.** It's strong. The opening line alone ("I'm the person teams call when AI ambition collides with delivery reality") is worth more than most people's entire profile. One adjustment:

**Add a two-line "currently" block at the end, before the invitation:**
```
Currently: Building agentic delivery accelerators at PwC, leading the 
AI Champions program, and shipping POCs that compress weeks into hours.
```
This gives it a "live" feel — you're not just describing a career, you're describing work happening right now.

#### Banner Image
**Replace the default with a custom banner.** This doesn't need to be fancy. Options:
- A simple typographic banner with your tagline: "Turning AI Ambition into Shipped Products" on a clean background in your brand palette
- A subtle pipeline/workflow diagram visual that signals "builder"
- A clean photo of you presenting or at a workshop (if available)

**Why:** The banner is the first visual signal. Default = "hasn't bothered." Custom = "thinks about how they show up."

#### Profile Photo
**If you don't have a strong headshot, get one.** It doesn't need to be a studio shoot. A well-lit photo, professional setting, eye contact, slight warmth. This is non-negotiable for every persona.

---

### 1.2 — Experience Section Upgrade (Day 2–3)

#### Current Role: Director, CT&I
Already well-drafted. Publish the bullets from LINKEDIN-PROFILE.md as-is. They're specific, metric-driven, and scannable.

#### Previous PwC Roles — Rewrite All of Them
The current drafts for Platform Engagement Lead, Product Portfolio Lead, and GM roles are generic ("Managed portfolio," "Drove adoption"). Each needs the same treatment as your current role: **one sentence of context + 3–4 specific bullets with outcomes.**

**Platform Engagement Lead (Nov 2022 – Oct 2024):**
```
Led ESG/Sustainability and Cloud & Digital product asset groups within 
Products & Technology Digital. Bridged investment planning and delivery 
execution for platform products approaching market readiness.

• Drove Climate Risk Financial Modeler (CRFM) expansion into 4 territories 
  in 6 months — Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany — paving the way for 
  5 additional launches
• Spearheaded PwC's first B2B2B data reseller model, building governance 
  and operating frameworks across sales, billing, and compliance that set 
  firmwide precedent
• Coordinated cross-functional delivery across 6+ asset teams, aligning 
  investment governance with product roadmaps and go-to-market execution
```

**Product Portfolio Lead — Workforce Transformation (Aug 2020 – Oct 2022):**
```
Led product portfolio for Workforce Transformation practice, including 
Workforce Orchestrator (Boarding Pass), Change Navigator, and Listen — 
enterprise SaaS platforms serving PwC's workforce consulting engagements.

• Owned product strategy and roadmap for 3 digital platforms spanning 
  employee onboarding, change management, and organizational listening
• Drove product-market fit for Workforce Orchestrator from internal tool 
  to client-facing SaaS offering
• Coordinated across engineering, design, business development, and 
  client delivery to maintain release cadence and client adoption
```

**General Manager — Digital Products (Dec 2019 – Aug 2020):**
```
Full P&L responsibility for Workforce Orchestrator digital SaaS product. 
Owned strategy, product development, business development, and customer 
engagement — a true general management role within PwC's digital practice.

• Defined product vision and go-to-market strategy for workforce 
  onboarding platform, securing executive buy-in and initial client pipeline
• Led cross-functional team spanning engineering, UX design, and 
  consulting delivery
• Established customer acquisition process and adoption metrics framework 
  that carried forward into product portfolio expansion
```

**Workplace from Facebook GTM Leader (May 2018 – Jul 2021):**
This role is missing from your drafts but it's important — it shows you've been on the *vendor* side. Marcus (alliance partner) will notice. Add it:
```
Developed and led PwC's Go-to-Market strategy for Workplace from Facebook 
(now Meta), bridging enterprise SaaS product strategy with consulting 
delivery. One of the few PwC leaders who operated at the alliance-vendor 
interface — understanding both the platform provider's needs and the 
consulting firm's delivery model.

• Built GTM playbook connecting Facebook's enterprise collaboration 
  platform to PwC's workforce transformation practice
• Led client-facing workshops and enablement sessions positioning 
  Workplace as a change management accelerator
• Served as bridge between Meta's product team and PwC's delivery 
  organization — translating platform capabilities into consulting 
  engagement models
```

**HP Roles (2008–2010) and DU Leadership Consultant (2005–2007):**
Add brief entries for these. They're origin story. They humanize you and extend your timeline beyond "PwC lifer":
```
Hewlett-Packard | Inside Sales → Field Sales (2008–2010)
Colorado Springs, CO → Boston, MA

Sold servers, storage, and networking to state and local government 
accounts. Transitioned from inside sales to field sales covering New 
England state governments. First exposure to enterprise professional 
services — partnered with Deloitte and SAP on a Massachusetts taxation 
system deal, which led directly to my introduction to PwC.

---

Delta Upsilon International Fraternity | Leadership Consultant (2005–2007)
Indianapolis, IN (traveling)

Traveled solo to 30+ chapters across the US and Canada — MIT, UPenn, 
Penn State, Carnegie Mellon, University of Toronto, Arizona State, Johns 
Hopkins. Learned to be useful fast, work without supervision, and serve 
people who didn't ask for my help. Low pay, extensive travel, formative.
```

---

### 1.3 — Featured Section (Day 3)

LinkedIn's Featured section lets you pin content at the top of your profile. Right now yours appears empty (or at least has nothing that surfaced publicly). This is prime real estate.

**Pin these (in order):**

1. **Your personal website link** (once built) — with a custom title like "How I Work: AI Delivery from Prototype to Production"
2. **One original post** (see Phase 3) — your first proof-of-work post
3. **Your whitepaper or a PDF** — you have `whitepaper-prompt-engineering-smb-business-case.pdf`. If it's publishable, feature it. A published artifact is worth more than 10 profile bullets.
4. **A link to SharpPrompt, PromptEngine, or SharpAsk** — if any are publicly accessible, pin them. These are real shipped products. They're proof.

---

### 1.4 — Recommendations Campaign (Day 3–7)

**Target: 4–6 new recommendations within 30 days.**

You need recommendations from people who represent your personas' trust networks:

| Recommender type | Who to ask | What to request |
|-----------------|-----------|----------------|
| **PwC Partner/MD** | Ian, Peter Frank, Sri, Vikas, Peter Golden — whoever you have the best relationship with | One paragraph on what it's like to work with you on delivery. Specific > generic. |
| **Delivery lead or peer** | Someone you've unblocked or enabled on a project | How you supported their work, technical credibility, speed |
| **Client contact** (if appropriate) | Anyone from Schwab, Cencora, Cushman, etc. who'd endorse your work | Impact, professionalism, ability to translate tech to business |
| **Alliance partner** | Zoom, Meta, or Salesforce contact | How you showed up differently than other consulting firm contacts |

**How to ask (use your voice):**
```
Hey [Name] — I'm updating my LinkedIn profile and trying to better 
represent the work I've been doing. Would you be open to writing a 
short recommendation? Even 2-3 sentences about our work together 
would mean a lot. Happy to return the favor.
```

**Why this matters:** One strong Partner recommendation ("Andrew built a prototype in 3 days that unlocked a $2M pursuit") does more for Rachel the recruiter, David the partner, and Sarah the C-suite buyer than anything else you can do on LinkedIn. It's third-party proof. It can't be faked.

---

### 1.5 — Skills & Keywords Optimization (Day 2)

Update your skills list to match the keywords your personas search for. Front-load the most important:

**Top skills (order matters — LinkedIn weights the first ones):**
1. Generative AI / LLMs
2. AI Agent Development
3. Digital Transformation
4. Product Management
5. Solution Architecture
6. Salesforce
7. Python
8. React
9. Azure
10. Change Management

**Add industry keywords to your About or Experience where natural:**
- Management Consulting
- Big Four
- Agentic AI
- Human-in-the-Loop
- CRM Modernization
- Regulated Industries
- Investment Governance

---

## Phase 2: Website Rebuild (Weeks 2–3)

**Goal:** A standalone site that serves as your depth layer, Google presence, and proof surface. Built with the brand system as the filter and the personas as the test.

---

### 2.1 — Architecture

**Single-page core** with optional expansion later. Sections in this order:

| # | Section | Persona it primarily serves | Content |
|---|---------|---------------------------|---------|
| 1 | **Hero** | All | Name + role + "Turning AI ambition into shipped products" + two CTAs (See How I Work / Connect) |
| 2 | **The Short Version** | David, Sarah, Rachel | 3-sentence summary: who you are, what you do, why you're different. 2–3 stats. |
| 3 | **What Sets Me Apart** | David, Sarah, Vikas | 4 pillars (strategy+engineering, prototype-led, AI as method, governance). One featured with a real artifact. |
| 4 | **How I Work** | Sarah, Marcus, Priya | 4-step process with specific, operational language ("Day 1–3: I'm in your codebase") |
| 5 | **Impact** | David, Rachel, Vikas | Named outcomes with one-sentence context. Metrics first, story second. |
| 6 | **What I've Built** | Sarah, Priya, Marcus | NEW SECTION. 3–4 named projects/products: SharpPrompt, PromptEngine, the agentic pipeline, the survey intelligence asset. Brief description + what it does. Links where available. |
| 7 | **Expertise** | Rachel, Marcus | Scannable tags organized by category. Named platforms for Marcus. |
| 8 | **The Journey** | All | Start at Vancouver, WA. Full arc. Human and honest. |
| 9 | **Connect** | All | LinkedIn + email. Warm invitation. |

### 2.2 — Design Direction

From the brand system — applied:

- **Light default** with dark mode toggle
- **Typography:** Variable Inter (body) + JetBrains Mono (stats, labels, technical)
- **Palette:** Warm off-white base, deep indigo accent, warm secondary for human moments
- **Spacing:** Generous. One thing at a time. Confidence through whitespace.
- **Motion:** Subtle scroll reveal. Clear hover states. Nothing that delays content.
- **Photography:** Professional headshot in hero or about section.
- **No stock images.** Diagrams, methodology visuals, or clean typography only.

### 2.3 — Technical

- Static HTML/CSS/JS (no framework bloat — matches "I ship lean")
- Self-hosted fonts or variable font subset for speed
- Target LCP < 2s
- WCAG 2.2 AA compliance
- Semantic HTML, proper heading structure
- Open Graph tags for LinkedIn/social sharing
- Meta description optimized for "Andrew Martin AI PwC"
- Clean, viewable source code (Priya will check)

### 2.4 — "What I've Built" Section (The Missing Piece)

This is the section that doesn't exist yet and should. It's the proof layer that separates you from everyone who claims to build.

**Candidates to feature:**

| Project | What it is | What to show |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| **Agentic CRM Migration Pipeline** | 10-agent pipeline that compresses weeks → hours | Architecture diagram showing agent roles, human-in-the-loop decision points |
| **Survey Intelligence Asset** | GenAI agent that reduced survey analysis by 90% | Before/after comparison, brief methodology |
| **SharpPrompt** | Chrome extension for prompt engineering | Screenshot + link to repo or Chrome Web Store |
| **PromptEngine** | iOS/web app for structured prompt building | Screenshot + brief description |
| **SharpAsk** | iOS app | Screenshot + brief description |
| **AI Assessment Framework** | 8-workstream codebase analysis methodology | Workstream diagram or sample output structure |

You don't need all of these. **3–4 strong ones** with a visual and one sentence each is enough to change the entire credibility equation.

---

## Phase 3: Content Engine (Ongoing, starting Week 1)

**Goal:** Transform your LinkedIn activity from "observer" to "builder who shares." This is what feeds visibility to every persona over time.

---

### 3.1 — Posting Framework

**Frequency:** 1–2 posts per week. Consistency matters more than volume.

**Format — every post follows this structure:**
```
[Outcome or insight — one sentence, specific]

[2-3 sentences of context: what the problem was, what you did, what happened]

[1 sentence takeaway or methodology point]

[Optional: invitation to engage — "Anyone else working on this?"]
```

**Voice:** Direct, proof-oriented, warm. From the brand system:
- Lead with the outcome, not the context
- Concrete beats abstract
- No "I'm humbled to announce"
- No engagement bait
- Treat every post like a compressed case study

### 3.2 — First 8 Posts (Starter Queue)

These are drafted from things you've already done. No new work required — just write up what happened.

| # | Topic | Angle | Persona it reaches |
|---|-------|-------|--------------------|
| 1 | **The 10-agent CRM migration pipeline** | "We compressed 3 weeks of CRM migration analysis into 4 hours. Here's the pipeline and what each agent does." | David, Sarah, Priya, Marcus |
| 2 | **Governance without bureaucracy** | "The fastest way to kill an AI project isn't technical failure — it's compliance blocking production. Here's how we build governance in from day one." | Sarah, Vikas |
| 3 | **Why I build the demo before the deck** | "Last month I had a prototype in the client's environment before the strategy doc was final. Here's why that order matters." | David, Sarah |
| 4 | **AI Champions program** | "We launched an AI Champions program across Advisory. 30/60/90 plan, success metrics, what worked and what we'd change." | Vikas, Marcus |
| 5 | **The 8-workstream codebase assessment** | "When we assess a codebase for production readiness, we cover 8 workstreams. Here's what they are and why 'just review the code' isn't enough." | Priya, Sarah |
| 6 | **From community college to PwC Director** | "I started at Clark College in Vancouver, WA. Transferred to WSU. Traveled solo to 30 fraternity chapters at 23. Here's what that taught me about being useful fast." | Rachel, Vikas (humanizing, differentiation) |
| 7 | **What I learned on the vendor side** | "I spent 3 years leading PwC's GTM for Workplace from Facebook. Being on the alliance side changed how I think about consulting delivery." | Marcus |
| 8 | **SharpPrompt / PromptEngine** | "I built a Chrome extension and an iOS app for structured prompt engineering. Here's why I build my own tools." | Priya, Sarah, Vikas |

### 3.3 — Engagement Habits

Beyond posting, build these into your weekly routine:

- **Comment substantively on 3–5 posts per week** from people in your network (Vikas, Ian, alliance contacts, industry peers). Not "Great post!" — add a perspective, a question, or a related experience. 2–3 sentences.
- **When you see a post about AI delivery, governance, or agentic AI from someone you respect** — repost it with your perspective added. This puts you in their audience's feed.
- **When Vikas or another PwC leader posts about CT&I work** — don't just like. Comment with specifics about what the team is building. This is the missed moment from the assessment — reclaim it going forward.

### 3.4 — Engagement Response Protocol

When people comment on your posts:
- Reply to every comment within 24 hours
- Be warm and specific: "Great question — we actually ran into that exact issue on the CRM migration. The human-in-the-loop checkpoint at stage 4 is where we caught it."
- If someone asks to connect or learn more, respond directly and warmly: "Happy to dig into this — send me a message and we can set up time."
